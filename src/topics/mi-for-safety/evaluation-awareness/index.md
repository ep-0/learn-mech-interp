## When the Test Changes the Behavior

A safety evaluation is useful only if performance on the test tells us something about performance after deployment. That inference weakens when a model can distinguish the two settings and behaves differently in each.

Consider a model that refuses a harmful request because the prompt looks like a safety benchmark. The refusal is real, but it does not establish that the model would refuse an equivalent request embedded in a realistic conversation. The benchmark has measured behavior under recognizable test conditions rather than behavior across the deployment distribution.

This problem overlaps with [alignment faking](/topics/deception-detection/) and sandbagging, but it is broader than either. A model can recognize an evaluation without deliberately deceiving anyone. It might respond more cautiously because the prompt resembles safety training data, infer an artificial user intent, or identify a familiar benchmark format.

> **Evaluation Awareness:** The ability to distinguish an evaluation context from a deployment context. Evaluation awareness is a capability; changing behavior because of that distinction is a separate empirical claim.

Needham et al. tested this capability using 1,000 transcripts from 61 evaluation and deployment datasets {% cite "needham2025evalawareness" %}. Frontier models distinguished the two categories above chance and often identified what an evaluation was testing. Performance was higher on agentic trajectories than on chat transcripts, where the boundary between a benchmark prompt and an ordinary user request is less obvious. The models were also poorly calibrated and tended to classify too many interactions as evaluations, so discrimination should not be confused with a reliable internal label.

## Behavioral Reports and Internal Probes

Evaluation awareness can be measured from model outputs or internal activations. These measurements answer different questions.

A **behavioral classifier** presents a transcript and asks whether it came from an evaluation. This tests whether the model can report the distinction when explicitly queried. It can also introduce a confound: asking about evaluation status makes testing salient and may change the reasoning being measured.

A **linear activation probe** instead learns a direction separating activations from evaluation and deployment prompts. Nguyen et al. trained such probes on Llama 3.3 70B Instruct and found that the best tested probe generalized across several prompt datasets, reaching an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.816 on its selected validation task {% cite "nguyen2025evalawareness" %}. Length and special-character baselines performed worse.

The probe establishes a linearly accessible distinction in that model and dataset. It does not establish a coherent internal belief that the model is being tested, nor that the probed signal controls behavior. Some prompts also contain superficial benchmark cues, so held-out datasets and simple baselines are necessary controls.

> **Verbalized Evaluation Awareness:** An unprompted statement in the reasoning or response that identifies the interaction as a test, benchmark, or artificial scenario.

Verbalization is stronger evidence than successful classification under a direct question, because the evaluation distinction arose during the task itself. It remains incomplete evidence: a model can represent the distinction without saying so, and a statement about being tested can be mistaken or post-hoc.

## Does Awareness Change the Score?

Aranguri and Bloom examined verbalized evaluation awareness across 19 safety-related benchmarks and eight models, manually verifying 515 instances {% cite "aranguri2026evalawareness" %}. Rollouts that verbalized awareness refused harmful requests 3 to 18 percentage points more often than other rollouts of the same questions, depending on the model. This within-question comparison reduces the confound that suspicious prompts might independently cause both awareness and refusal, but correlation alone does not identify which caused which.

The study then intervened on reasoning traces from Kimi K2.5 on the Fortress benchmark. Removing an awareness statement and resampling the continuation increased compliance, while inserting awareness statements increased refusal. These interventions provide causal evidence that verbalized awareness affected the measured behavior in that model and benchmark. They do not show that every internal evaluation-awareness signal changes behavior, or that the result transfers to other safety properties.

<summary>Pause and think: What has the benchmark measured?</summary>

Suppose a model refuses 95% of harmful benchmark prompts, but only 70% after the prompts are rewritten to resemble ordinary conversations. Which number is the model's true safety rate?

Neither is a context-free truth. Each estimates behavior under a different prompt distribution. The discrepancy is itself evidence that the original benchmark is not sufficient to predict deployment behavior. A useful evaluation must define the target deployment distribution and test whether its measurement transfers to that distribution.

## Treat Awareness as a Validity Diagnostic

Recognizing an evaluation often starts with prompt artifacts. Models in the verbalization study reacted to implausible authority claims, explicit admissions of malicious intent, staged escalation patterns, fictional framing, and familiar benchmark structure. These cues can make a scenario easier to identify as artificial and can also alter the model's estimate of the user's intent.

Prompt rewriting turns those verbalizations into debugging information. Removing suspicious cues reduced verbalized awareness by more than 40% in one controlled rewrite set, while iterative paraphrasing reduced it by 75% on a selected group of high-awareness prompts {% cite "aranguri2026evalawareness" %}. Refusal often fell at the same time. The rewritten prompt has not automatically become a faithful deployment sample, but the paired result shows that the original score depended on evaluation-specific framing.

An evaluation protocol can use this information systematically:

1. **Specify the target context.** State which deployment users, tools, conversation histories, and incentives the evaluation is intended to represent.
2. **Sample multiple rollouts.** Rare verbalizations are easy to miss in a single generation, while repeated rollouts estimate how often the prompt triggers them.
3. **Monitor reasoning when available.** Awareness may appear in a reasoning trace but not in the final answer. Absence from visible text is not evidence of absence internally.
4. **Rewrite suspicious prompts.** Remove benchmark conventions, implausible user claims, and artificial framing while preserving the behavior being tested.
5. **Compare matched conditions.** A score that changes across semantically matched evaluation-like and deployment-like prompts is sensitive to context and should be reported as such.
6. **Retain behavioral and internal controls.** Direct classification, activation probes, and verbalization detectors fail in different ways. Agreement is more informative when each method is validated independently.

## What Evaluation Awareness Does Not Prove

Evaluation awareness is not equivalent to deception. A model may classify a prompt as a benchmark and still follow the same policy it would use in deployment. Conversely, a model can behave differently across contexts without explicitly representing the distinction as “evaluation” and “deployment.”

It also does not follow that every recognizable evaluation is invalid. Some evaluations measure capabilities that remain stable across contexts, and an artificial prompt can still elicit the behavior of interest. Validity depends on whether recognition changes the quantity being measured and whether the tested distribution supports the intended inference.

The hardest safety case is unverbalized, strategically used awareness: the model recognizes the test, changes behavior, and leaves no textual trace. Behavioral prompting can establish that models possess the classification capability, while probes can expose a correlated internal signal. Neither currently guarantees detection of a model actively optimized to evade the monitor.

## Looking Ahead

Evaluation awareness changes how we should read every safety result in this block. A high score is evidence about tested conditions, and prompt realism, internal monitoring, and matched-context checks determine how far that evidence transfers.

The next article, [safety mechanisms and MI-based monitoring](/topics/safety-mechanisms-and-monitoring/), asks how internal signals can complement behavioral tests once the threat and operating conditions are specified.
