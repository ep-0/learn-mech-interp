glossary:
  - term: "OV Circuit"
    definition: "The component of an attention head formed by the product of the value (W_V) and output (W_O) weight matrices. The OV circuit determines what information is written to the residual stream when a token is attended to."
  - term: "QK Circuit"
    definition: "The component of an attention head formed by the product of the query (W_Q) and key (W_K) weight matrices. The QK circuit determines which tokens attend to which other tokens by computing attention scores."

exitCriteria:
  - task: "In GPT-2 small, $d_{\\text{model}} = 768$ and $d_k = 64$. The QK circuit $W_{QK}^h$ is a $768 \\times 768$ matrix. What is its maximum rank, and what does that bound tell you about what one head can do?"
    answer: |
      Rank at most $64$. $W_{QK}^h = W_Q^h (W_K^h)^T$ is a product of a $768 \times 64$ matrix with a $64 \times 768$ matrix, and the rank of a product cannot exceed the smaller inner dimension.

      The consequence is a hard bottleneck on routing. The bilinear form $\mathbf{x}_i W_{QK} \mathbf{x}_j^T$ can only see the projection of each residual state into a $64$-dimensional subspace — $8\%$ of the stream. Everything orthogonal to that subspace is invisible to this head's attention decision, no matter how large it is.

      So any claim that a single head attends on the basis of some rich, many-featured criterion is bounded by $64$ dimensions of evidence. A head can implement "attend to the previous token" or "attend to a repeated token" comfortably; a criterion requiring hundreds of independent features has to be built by composition across heads and layers. The same bound with $d_v$ in place of $d_k$ constrains the OV circuit's write.
  - task: "State what entry $(i, j)$ means in each of $W_E W_{QK}^h W_E^T$ and $W_E W_{OV}^h W_U$. Then say how you would use one of them to test the claim \"this head copies whatever it attends to.\""
    answer: |
      **$W_E W_{QK}^h W_E^T$**, entry $(i,j)$: how much a destination position holding token $i$ attends to a source position holding token $j$, on the basis of token identity alone. A token-to-token relevance matrix.

      **$W_E W_{OV}^h W_U$**, entry $(i,j)$: if the head attends to a source position holding token $i$, how much does that raise the output logit for token $j$? A token-to-logit effect matrix.

      To test a copying claim, use the OV matrix and look at the **diagonal**. Copying means "attending to token $i$ raises the logit for token $i$," so the claim predicts that entry $(i,i)$ is large relative to the off-diagonal entries in row $i$. The standard summary statistic is the fraction of vocabulary rows whose diagonal entry is the row maximum, or a positive-eigenvalue measure of the matrix.

      Two caveats. The matrix only describes the direct path, so in a deep model it omits everything routed through intermediate components. And a head can copy *classes* rather than tokens — raising the logits for all names when it attends to a name — which shows as block structure, not a diagonal.
  - task: "Why do we study the products $W_Q W_K^T$ and $W_V W_O$ rather than the four matrices individually? Give the mathematical reason, not just the convenience one."
    answer: |
      Because the individual matrices are not well defined by the model, and the products are.

      Insert any invertible $M \in \mathbb{R}^{d_k \times d_k}$ between the two factors: replace $W_Q$ with $W_Q M$ and $W_K$ with $W_K (M^{-1})^T$. Then

      $$(W_Q M)\left(W_K (M^{-1})^T\right)^T = W_Q M M^{-1} W_K^T = W_Q W_K^T,$$

      so the model computes exactly the same attention scores while both matrices have changed. The same argument with $W_V W_O$ shows the head's write is unchanged under $W_V \mapsto W_V M$, $W_O \mapsto M^{-1} W_O$. There is a continuous family of parameter settings implementing the identical head.

      Any statement about $W_Q$ alone — its singular values, which directions it emphasizes, its similarity to another head's $W_Q$ — is therefore a statement about an arbitrary choice from that family, not about the model. The products are the invariants, so they are what carries meaning. This is the same lesson as the residual stream's non-privileged basis, one level down.
  - task: "The end-to-end QK circuit is described as a directly interpretable token-to-token matrix. Explain why it is a poor description of a head in layer 9 of a 12-layer model, and what replaces it."
    answer: |
      The object $W_E W_{QK}^h W_E^T$ computes attention scores as if the residual states at both positions were the raw token embeddings. That is close to true at layer 0, where the stream *is* the embedding plus positional information. By layer 9 the stream is the embedding plus the writes of nine layers of heads and MLPs, and the embedding term is typically a small part of it.

      So the matrix describes only the **direct embedding path** — the contribution to the attention score attributable to bare token identity. In a deep layer that path may account for very little of the observed score, and a head that looks uninteresting under this matrix may be routing on features that no token-level analysis can see.

      What replaces it is a decomposition in **feature** space rather than token space: expand each residual state into the contributions that built it, and attribute the bilinear score to pairs of (query-side contribution, key-side contribution). [Circuit tracing](/topics/circuit-tracing/) develops this as QK attribution, using sparse features as the expansion basis.

## The Residual Stream as a Vector Space

The [residual stream](/topics/transformer-architecture/#the-residual-stream) is more than just a convenient name. It is a $d_{\text{model}}$-dimensional vector that lives in $\mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}}}$, and treating it as a proper vector space unlocks the mathematical framework behind mechanistic interpretability {% cite "elhage2021mathematical" %}.

If you want a refresher on prerequisites or a full architecture walkthrough, start with [Prerequisites](/topics/mi-prerequisites/) and [Transformer Architecture Intro](/topics/transformer-architecture/).

At each token position, the residual stream starts as the token embedding and accumulates additive updates from every attention head and MLP layer. The final residual stream at any position decomposes as a sum:

$$
\mathbf{r}^L = \underbrace{\text{Embed}(\mathbf{x})}_{\text{token embedding}} + \underbrace{\sum_{l=0}^{L-1} \sum_{h=1}^{H} \text{Attn}^{l,h}}_{\text{all attention heads}} + \underbrace{\sum_{l=0}^{L-1} \text{MLP}^l}_{\text{all MLPs}}
$$

Each term in this sum is a vector in $\mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}}}$. Every component *reads* the current residual stream and *writes* an update back to it.{% sidenote "Components can favor different read and write subspaces. Orthogonal direct subspaces do not interact through a simple dot product, but normalization and later components can still couple their effects. Additivity makes bookkeeping possible; it does not make the full computation independent." %}

> **Residual Stream (Formal):** The residual stream is the $d_{\text{model}}$-dimensional vector that flows through the transformer, starting as the token embedding and accumulating additive updates from each attention head and MLP layer.

The additive residual stream lets us isolate a component's direct contribution and ask how it affected a prediction. Later components can transform or compensate for that update, so studying terms separately is a useful starting point rather than a complete account of causality.

## Two Jobs, One Head

Each attention head does two conceptually independent things. First, it decides *where to move information*: which source tokens should each destination token attend to? Second, it decides *what information to move*: given the attended tokens, what gets copied to the output?

These two jobs are controlled by two parameter products: the **QK circuit** and the **OV circuit**. The four weight matrices of an attention head ($W_Q$, $W_K$, $W_V$, $W_O$) factor into these two products, which can be inspected separately while remembering that the head's behavior also depends on its inputs.

</figure>

## The QK Circuit

> **QK Circuit:** The QK circuit of attention head $h$ is the matrix $W_{QK}^h = W_Q^h (W_K^h)^T$. It determines the attention pattern: which source tokens each destination token attends to.

The attention score between tokens $i$ and $j$ can be written directly in terms of the QK circuit:

$$
e_{i,j} = \mathbf{x}_i \, W_{QK}^h \, \mathbf{x}_j^T
$$

where $\mathbf{x}_i$ and $\mathbf{x}_j$ are the residual stream vectors at positions $i$ and $j$. This is a bilinear form on $\mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}}}$: it takes two residual stream vectors and produces a scalar score. No separate query and key vectors need to be computed; the QK circuit matrix directly answers "how much should token $i$ attend to token $j$?"{% sidenote "The QK circuit is a $d_{\\text{model}} \\times d_{\\text{model}}$ matrix, but it has rank at most $d_k$ because it is the product of a $d_{\\text{model}} \\times d_k$ matrix with a $d_k \\times d_{\\text{model}}$ matrix. This low-rank structure means each head can only compute attention scores using a $d_k$-dimensional subspace of the residual stream." %}

We can go further. Including the embedding and unembedding matrices, the *full end-to-end QK circuit* maps tokens to attention scores:

$$
W_E \, W_{QK}^h \, W_E^T
$$

This is an $n_{\text{vocab}} \times n_{\text{vocab}}$ matrix. Entry $(i, j)$ tells us "how much does token $i$ attend to token $j$, based purely on token identity?" This is a directly interpretable object: a token-to-token attention score matrix that we can inspect.

## The OV Circuit

> **OV Circuit:** The OV circuit of attention head $h$ is the matrix $W_{OV}^h = W_V^h W_O^h$. It determines what information is moved from attended-to tokens to the destination.

The output contribution from source token $j$ to destination token $i$ is:

$$
\text{contribution}_j = \alpha_{i,j} \cdot \mathbf{x}_j \, W_{OV}^h
$$

where $\alpha_{i,j}$ is the attention weight. The OV circuit is a single matrix that transforms each source token's information before writing it to the residual stream. Like the QK circuit, it has rank at most $d_v$, creating a low-rank bottleneck that forces the head to compress its processing into a limited-dimensional subspace.

The full end-to-end OV circuit, including the unembedding, is:

$$
W_E \, W_{OV}^h \, W_U
$$

This is also an $n_{\text{vocab}} \times n_{\text{vocab}}$ matrix. Entry $(i, j)$ tells us "if the head attends to token $i$, how much does that increase the logit for token $j$?" This directly reveals the *effect on predictions* of attending to a given token.

## QK vs. OV: Side by Side

The two circuits have complementary roles:

| | QK Circuit (Where to Look) | OV Circuit (What to Move) |
|---|---|---|
| **Matrix** | $W_{QK}^h = W_Q^h (W_K^h)^T$ | $W_{OV}^h = W_V^h W_O^h$ |
| **Input** | Two token positions | A source token |
| **Output** | An attention score | An update to the residual stream |
| **Answers** | "Should I attend here?" | "What should I copy?" |
| **End-to-end** | $W_E \, W_{QK}^h \, W_E^T$ | $W_E \, W_{OV}^h \, W_U$ |
| **Interpretation** | Token-to-token relevance | Token-to-logit effect |

Every attention head decomposes into these two circuits. This is more than compact notation: it separates *where* the head looks from *what* it moves. The two parameter products are independent, although their effects inside a full model still interact with the residual stream, normalization, and later layers.

<details class="pause-and-think">
<summary>Pause and think: Why independence matters</summary>

Consider an attention head that always attends to the previous token (a "previous token head"). Its QK circuit determines *where* it looks (always one position back). Its OV circuit determines *what* it copies from that position. You could change what the head copies without changing where it looks, or vice versa. Why is this independence important for mechanistic interpretability? What would it mean if the two circuits were entangled instead?

</details>

## A Worked Example

To make the QK/OV decomposition concrete, consider a tiny 1-layer, attention-only transformer with $d_{\text{model}} = 4$, one attention head, and no MLP or layer norm. We trace a 2-token input through the standard computation, then verify that the circuit view gives identical results.

**Setup.** Embedding vectors $\mathbf{x}_A = (1, 0, 1, -1)$ and $\mathbf{x}_B = (0, 1, -1, 1)$. Weight matrices: $W_Q = I_4$ (identity), $W_K$ is a permutation that swaps entry pairs $(1 \leftrightarrow 2)$ and $(3 \leftrightarrow 4)$, $W_V$ is a permutation that swaps entries 2 and 3, and $W_O = I_4$.

**Standard computation.** Since $W_Q = I$, the queries equal the embeddings: $\mathbf{q}_A = (1, 0, 1, -1)$ and $\mathbf{q}_B = (0, 1, -1, 1)$. For the keys, $W_K$ swaps pairs: $\mathbf{k}_A = (0, 1, -1, 1)$ and $\mathbf{k}_B = (1, 0, 1, -1)$.

The raw attention scores for token A are $e_{AA} = \mathbf{q}_A \cdot \mathbf{k}_A = -2$ and $e_{AB} = \mathbf{q}_A \cdot \mathbf{k}_B = 3$. Scaling by $1/\sqrt{d_k} = 1/2$ gives $-1$ and $1.5$, and softmax yields $\alpha_{AA} \approx 0.08$ and $\alpha_{AB} \approx 0.92$. Token A pays 92% of its attention to token B.

The values are $\mathbf{v}_A = (1, 1, 0, -1)$ and $\mathbf{v}_B = (0, -1, 1, 1)$ (after $W_V$ swaps entries 2 and 3). The attention output for token A is $\text{out}_A = 0.08 \cdot \mathbf{v}_A + 0.92 \cdot \mathbf{v}_B \approx (0.08, -0.84, 0.92, 0.84)$.{% sidenote "The output is dominated by $\\mathbf{v}_B$ because A attends mostly to B. The QK circuit determined *where* A should look (at B), and the OV circuit determined *what* gets copied (B's value vector, transformed by $W_V$)." %}

**The QK circuit view.** The QK circuit matrix is $W_{QK} = W_Q W_K^T = I \cdot W_K^T = W_K^T$. Since $W_K$ is a symmetric permutation, $W_{QK} = W_K$. Computing the attention score directly:

$$
e_{AB} = \mathbf{x}_A \, W_{QK} \, \mathbf{x}_B^T = 3 \quad \checkmark
$$

Same answer as the standard computation, in a single matrix multiplication.

**The OV circuit view.** The OV circuit matrix is $W_{OV} = W_V W_O = W_V \cdot I = W_V$. The output from attending to token B is $\mathbf{x}_B \, W_{OV} = (0, -1, 1, 1) = \mathbf{v}_B$, matching exactly.

**The takeaway.** The standard four-matrix view ($W_Q$, $W_K$, $W_V$, $W_O$) and the two-circuit view ($W_{QK}$, $W_{OV}$) produce identical results. But the circuit view reveals the structure: the QK circuit is a single matrix that directly gives attention scores, and the OV circuit is a single matrix that directly gives the output transformation. Each head has exactly two independent functions, and we can study them separately.

<details class="pause-and-think">
<summary>Pause and think: Extending the example</summary>

In this toy example, $W_Q$ and $W_O$ were identity matrices for simplicity. In a real transformer, all four weight matrices are learned. How would the QK and OV circuits change if $W_Q$ were not the identity? Would the *independence* of the two circuits still hold? Think about what conditions are needed for the QK circuit to be truly independent from the OV circuit.

</details>

## The One-Layer Model

For a one-layer, attention-only model, the full output has a clean closed form:

$$
T(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x} + \sum_h A^h (\mathbf{x} \, W_{OV}^h)
$$

where $A^h$ is the attention pattern matrix produced by the QK circuit and softmax. The model output is the original token embedding plus a sum of OV-circuit outputs, weighted by the attention patterns. Every part of this expression is inspectable: $A^h$ tells us where each head looked, and $W_{OV}^h$ tells us what it moved.{% sidenote "This clean decomposition is why one-layer and two-layer attention-only transformers are the starting point for much of the mathematical framework in Elhage et al. (2021). The absence of MLPs and the limited depth make it possible to write the full computation as a sum of interpretable terms." %}

This decomposition is the foundation for the composition framework covered in the next article. When we stack multiple layers, layer 2 heads can read the outputs of layer 1 heads from the residual stream, creating [composed behaviors](/topics/composition-and-virtual-heads/) that neither head could achieve alone.

## From Token Space to Feature Space

The QK/OV decomposition provides the vocabulary researchers use to describe what attention heads do. Calling a head a "previous token head" or an "induction head" makes two claims: its QK circuit selects a particular source, and its OV circuit writes a particular effect. The framework from Elhage et al. {% cite "elhage2021mathematical" %} turns four opaque weight matrices into two objects with distinct functional roles.

The mathematical framework also gives us concrete, inspectable matrices. The end-to-end QK circuit $W_E W_{QK}^h W_E^T$ is a vocabulary-sized matrix we can examine entry by entry. The end-to-end OV circuit $W_E W_{OV}^h W_U$ directly tells us how attending to each token affects the output logits. These are not abstractions; they are real, computable objects that researchers use every day to understand what transformers learn.

The token-to-token view is most direct in shallow models where the residual stream is close to the token embeddings. In deeper models, each position contains a mixture of learned features. [Circuit Tracing](/topics/circuit-tracing/) develops **QK attribution**, which expands those residual streams into sparse features and decomposes an observed attention score into query-feature and key-feature interactions.
