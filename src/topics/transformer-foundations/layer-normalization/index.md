## Why Normalize the Residual Stream?

Deep transformers are difficult to optimize when the scale of the residual stream drifts across layers. Attention scores can saturate, nonlinearities can move into poorly conditioned regimes, and gradients can become unstable. Layer normalization gives each sublayer an input with a controlled scale, though normalization-free transformers can work when the architecture and initialization are designed for them.

The [residual stream](/topics/transformer-architecture/#the-residual-stream) remains an exact sum of component updates in a pre-norm transformer, but later sublayers read a normalized version of that sum. Their responses are therefore not linear functions of the earlier contributions. Direct additive decompositions are exact at the point of addition and approximate when used to describe downstream effects.

For mechanistic interpretability (MI), normalization complicates an otherwise clean picture of the residual stream as a sum of component writes. We therefore need to understand both what layer normalization computes and when an analysis may safely approximate it.

## What Layer Normalization Does

> **Layer Normalization:** Given an input vector $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$, layer normalization computes:
>
> $$\text{LN}(\mathbf{x}) = \gamma \odot \frac{\mathbf{x} - \mu}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \epsilon}} + \beta$$
>
> where $\mu = \frac{1}{d}\sum_i x_i$ is the mean, $\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{d}\sum_i (x_i - \mu)^2$ is the variance, $\gamma$ and $\beta$ are learned per-dimension scale and shift parameters, $\epsilon$ is a small constant for numerical stability, and $\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication.

The operation has two stages {% cite "ba2016layernorm" %}. First, the input is centered (subtract the mean) and rescaled (divide by the standard deviation), producing a vector with zero mean and unit variance. Second, the learned parameters $\gamma$ and $\beta$ apply an element-wise affine transformation, allowing the model to undo the normalization in directions where it is not helpful.

Layer normalization operates *within* one token's vector, independently of other positions and examples in the batch.{% sidenote "Batch normalization instead estimates statistics across a batch. Layer normalization avoids making a token's representation depend on which other examples happen to share its batch." %} Apart from the small $\epsilon$ term, multiplying the whole input by a positive scalar leaves the normalized result unchanged before the learned affine transform. A sublayer reading only the normalized vector cannot directly recover that overall scale.

## Why Transformers Need It

The residual stream accumulates updates from every attention head and MLP. Without some control from initialization, architecture, or normalization, its scale can drift with depth. Later sublayers may then receive poorly scaled inputs: attention logits can enter saturated regimes, nonlinearities can operate far from their useful range, and gradients can become hard to optimize.

Layer normalization constrains the scale of activations entering each sublayer. In a pre-norm transformer, each attention and MLP block receives an input with controlled variance even if the raw residual stream grows. This is one widely used route to stable optimization in deep transformers. A model trained with normalization generally cannot have those operations removed after training, because the rest of its weights were learned around normalized inputs.

## Pre-Norm vs. Post-Norm

The original transformer {% cite "vaswani2017attention" %} placed layer normalization *after* each residual connection (post-norm):

$$\mathbf{r}^{l+1} = \text{LN}(\mathbf{r}^l + \text{Sublayer}(\mathbf{r}^l))$$

Most modern architectures, including GPT-2 and its descendants, instead place layer normalization *before* each sublayer (pre-norm):

$$\mathbf{r}^{l+1} = \mathbf{r}^l + \text{Sublayer}(\text{LN}(\mathbf{r}^l))$$

The difference matters for training stability. With post-norm, the gradients must flow back through the layer normalization at every layer, which can create optimization difficulties. With pre-norm, the residual connection provides an unimpeded gradient path from the output back to the input, making training more stable {% cite "xiong2020prenorm" %}. Pre-norm models can typically be trained with larger learning rates and converge more reliably.{% sidenote "Xiong et al. showed theoretically that in pre-norm transformers, the gradients are well-behaved at initialization, while post-norm transformers require careful learning rate warmup to avoid divergence. This is why most modern LLMs use pre-norm, and it is the architecture assumed in most MI research." %}

For mechanistic interpretability, the pre-norm placement has a practical advantage: the residual stream *after* each sublayer addition is the raw sum of all previous contributions, not a normalized version. This is why MI researchers typically analyze the pre-layer-norm residual stream (the `hook_resid_pre` activation in TransformerLens), where the additive decomposition holds exactly. The normalization only affects what each sublayer *sees as input*, not the residual stream itself.

## RMSNorm

> **RMSNorm:** A variant of layer normalization that drops the mean-centering step and normalizes by the root mean square:
>
> $$\text{RMSNorm}(\mathbf{x}) = \gamma \odot \frac{\mathbf{x}}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{d}\sum_i x_i^2 + \epsilon}}$$

RMSNorm {% cite "zhang2019rmsnorm" %} simplifies layer normalization by removing the mean subtraction. This saves computation and removes invariance to adding the same constant to every coordinate. Its root-mean-square denominator still depends on every dimension, so changing one coordinate can rescale all the others. The original study found performance comparable to layer normalization in its experiments; results still depend on the architecture and training setup.

RMSNorm is used in LLaMA, Gemma, and several other modern architectures. For MI purposes, it introduces the same fundamental complication as full layer normalization: the division by a norm that depends on all dimensions creates a nonlinear coupling. The practical treatment is the same.

## Why Layer Norm Matters for MI

Layer normalization creates three specific complications for mechanistic interpretability.

**It makes downstream effects nonlinear.** The raw pre-norm residual stream is still an exact sum of component writes. But each sublayer receives $\text{LN}(\mathbf{r})$, so its response to one write depends on the rest of the residual state. A logit-lens projection of one fixed state is a well-defined readout, and direct logit attribution can hold the final normalization scale fixed for that input. What becomes approximate is treating each earlier component as if it independently caused its projected share of the downstream result.

**It couples all dimensions.** Changing one coordinate of $\mathbf{x}$ changes both $\mu$ and $\sigma$, which shifts the normalized value of other coordinates. A write from one attention head can therefore change how subsequent blocks read the combined residual state, even though the writes themselves still add exactly.

**It removes overall scale from each sublayer's input.** The raw residual stream still retains its norm along the skip path, but a normalized attention or MLP block cannot directly read that single scalar. Most information available to the block lies in the centered direction of the vector.

### How Researchers Handle It

In practice, layer normalization is treated as a manageable approximation rather than a fundamental obstacle. Several strategies are common:

**Analyzing pre-LN activations.** In pre-norm transformers, the residual stream before layer normalization (`hook_resid_pre` in TransformerLens) is the raw sum of all previous contributions. The additive decomposition is exact at this point. Researchers typically analyze this representation.

**Folding fixed parameters into weights.** TransformerLens provides a `fold_ln` option that absorbs learned affine parameters into adjacent weights and biases. This exact reparameterization makes some analyses cleaner, but it does not remove the input-dependent normalization itself. Centering and scaling still depend on the current residual state and must be retained or approximated explicitly.{% sidenote "Folding changes where fixed parameters are written in the computation; it does not turn layer normalization into a globally linear operation. Always distinguish an exact parameter reorganization from an approximation that freezes input-dependent statistics." %}

**The high-dimensional argument.** Changing one coordinate by a typical-sized amount affects the mean and variance by terms that shrink with $d$. This can make normalization's cross-coordinate coupling small in wide residual streams. It is not a blanket guarantee: an update spread across many coordinates, or one large enough to change the vector norm materially, can change the normalization factor appreciably.

<details class="pause-and-think">
<summary>Pause and think: Why does the linear decomposition work?</summary>

If layer normalization couples all dimensions, why does the linear decomposition of the residual stream still work well enough for techniques like direct logit attribution to give meaningful results?

One reason is dimensionality: no typical coordinate dominates the mean or variance in a wide residual stream. Another is empirical, many interventions of interest do not change the residual norm enough to overturn a first-order analysis. Neither condition is automatic, so the approximation should be checked when an intervention is large or a result depends on small differences.

## Looking Ahead

The next article, [QK and OV Circuits](/topics/qk-ov-circuits/), deliberately sets layer normalization aside to present the clean linear algebra of attention head decomposition. This is the standard practice in MI research: develop the theory under the linear approximation, then account for LN effects when precision matters. Later articles on [DLA](/topics/direct-logit-attribution/) and the [logit lens](/topics/logit-lens-and-tuned-lens/) will note specifically where the LN approximation affects their conclusions.
