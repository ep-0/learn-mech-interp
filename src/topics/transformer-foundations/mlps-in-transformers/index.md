## The Other Half of the Transformer

Every transformer layer has two components. [Attention](/topics/attention-mechanism/) moves information between positions, letting tokens communicate across the sequence. But after attention has routed information, a second component processes it: the **MLP** (multi-layer perceptron), also called the feed-forward network. Unlike attention, the MLP operates independently on each position. It does no cross-token communication. Instead, it transforms the information that attention has gathered, applying nonlinear computations within each position.

MLPs hold roughly two-thirds of a transformer's parameters, yet for years their function remained opaque. While attention heads have interpretable structure (queries match keys, values get copied), the MLP is just a matrix multiply, a nonlinearity, and another matrix multiply. What could it possibly be doing with all those parameters?

Several studies offer useful, partially overlapping views of MLPs: as banks of input–output associations, as contributors to vocabulary predictions, and as parts of larger factual-recall circuits. None makes individual neurons a universally reliable unit of explanation, but together they give us hypotheses we can test.

## The MLP Equation

The [architecture article](/topics/transformer-architecture/) introduced the MLP as a local computation step. Here is the full equation:

$$
\text{MLP}(\mathbf{x}) = \sigma(\mathbf{x} W_{\text{in}} + \mathbf{b}_{\text{in}}) \cdot W_{\text{out}} + \mathbf{b}_{\text{out}}
$$

where $W_{\text{in}} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d_m}$ projects the $d$-dimensional residual stream to a hidden layer of dimension $d_m$ (typically $4d$), $\sigma$ is a nonlinear activation (GELU in GPT-2), and $W_{\text{out}} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_m \times d}$ projects back down. This is the standard two-layer feed-forward network.

The up-projection to a $4\times$ wider hidden layer followed by a down-projection creates an expansion-compression bottleneck. The model has $d_m$ "slots" in the hidden layer, each of which can activate (or not) on a given input. The nonlinearity $\sigma$ acts as a gate, determining which slots fire. The output is a weighted combination of contributions from the active slots.

The residual stream is updated additively:

$$
\mathbf{r}^{l+1} = \mathbf{r}^{l+} + \text{MLP}^l(\mathbf{r}^{l+})
$$

where $\mathbf{r}^{l+}$ is the residual stream after attention in layer $l$. Like attention, the MLP reads from and writes to the [residual stream](/topics/transformer-architecture/#the-residual-stream). Its contribution can be isolated and measured independently.

## MLPs as Key-Value Memories

Geva et al. interpreted the structure of the MLP computation as a key-value memory {% cite "geva2021kvmemories" %}. Expand the matrix multiplication:

$$
\text{MLP}(\mathbf{x}) = \sigma(\mathbf{x} W_{\text{in}}) \cdot W_{\text{out}} = \sum_{i=1}^{d_m} \sigma(\mathbf{k}_i \cdot \mathbf{x}) \; \mathbf{v}_i
$$

where $\mathbf{k}_i$ is the $i$-th column of $W_{\text{in}}$ (the "key" for neuron $i$) and $\mathbf{v}_i$ is the $i$-th row of $W_{\text{out}}$ (the "value" for neuron $i$). We have dropped the biases for clarity.{% sidenote "With the bias terms included, the activation becomes $\\sigma(\\mathbf{k}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{x} + b_i)$, which shifts the threshold at which neuron $i$ activates. The value vector is still $\\mathbf{v}_i$, and the output still sums over active neurons. The key-value interpretation holds with or without biases." %}

> **Key-Value Memory (MLP):** Each of the $d_m$ neurons in an MLP layer acts as a key-value pair. The key $\mathbf{k}_i$ (a column of $W_{\text{in}}$) computes a match score with the input via a dot product. If the match passes the nonlinearity, the value $\mathbf{v}_i$ (a row of $W_{\text{out}}$) is added to the output, scaled by the activation strength. The MLP output is a weighted sum of value vectors from all active neurons.

The algebra has the form of a soft key-value lookup: the input is matched against a bank of vectors, and the corresponding output vectors are combined. Calling these vectors “memories” is an interpretation of that structure, not proof that each neuron stores one discrete fact. The nonlinearity $\sigma$ acts as a gate that changes how strongly each pair contributes.

The memory coefficients (activation strengths) determine how much each value vector contributes.

</figure>

Geva et al. studied a 16-layer transformer and examined what the keys and values actually encode {% cite "geva2021kvmemories" %}. By collecting the inputs that maximally activate each neuron (the inputs that best match each key), they found interpretable patterns:

- **Lower layers (1-9):** Keys predominantly match **shallow textual patterns**. Neuron $i$ in layer 3 might activate on inputs containing specific n-grams, punctuation patterns, or syntactic constructions.
- **Upper layers (10-16):** Keys match **semantic patterns**. Neuron $j$ in layer 14 might activate on inputs about European geography, regardless of the specific wording.

This stratification mirrors what we see with attention heads (earlier layers handle syntax, later layers handle semantics), but here it arises in a different component and through a different mechanism. Attention heads learn *where to look*. MLP neurons learn *what patterns to recognize* and *what information to retrieve* in response.

## Sparse Activation

Not every neuron fires on every input. Geva et al. found that only about 10-50% of the $d_m$ neurons in a given layer activate for any particular input {% cite "geva2021kvmemories" %}. This means the MLP output is dominated by a relatively small subset of value vectors on each forward pass.

This sparsity is not just an empirical curiosity. Zhang et al. showed that MLP neurons naturally cluster into functional groups, and that routing each input to only the relevant 10-30% of neurons preserves over 95% of model performance {% cite "zhang2022moefication" %}. In effect, the dense MLP already behaves like a sparse mixture of experts, even though it was not designed or trained to be one.{% sidenote "This observation connects to a broader finding about activation sparsity in transformers. As models scale, activation sparsity tends to increase: larger models use a smaller fraction of their MLP neurons for any given input. This is part of why sparse autoencoders work well on MLP activations, and why transcoders can replace MLPs with wider but sparser alternatives." %}

The practical implication is that the MLP at each layer applies a different *subset* of its key-value memory to each input. When the model processes "The Eiffel Tower is in ___", the active neurons at layer 10 might be those whose keys match geographic entities and European landmarks, while the neurons matching, say, programming syntax remain inactive.

<summary>Pause and think: Keys and values</summary>

Consider the MLP equation decomposed as a sum over neurons: $\text{MLP}(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_i \sigma(\mathbf{k}_i \cdot \mathbf{x}) \, \mathbf{v}_i$. If you had access to the weight matrices of a trained model, how would you investigate what a specific neuron "knows"? What would you look at to understand key $\mathbf{k}_i$, and what would you look at to understand value $\mathbf{v}_i$?

For the key: you could collect many inputs and find which ones produce the highest dot product $\mathbf{k}_i \cdot \mathbf{x}$ (i.e., which inputs maximally activate the neuron). The common patterns among these inputs tell you what the neuron detects. For the value: you need to know what the value vector *does* when added to the residual stream. The next section shows how.

## Values Promote Concepts in Vocabulary Space

Knowing that neurons match patterns (keys) and retrieve information (values) is a start, but what kind of information do the values encode? Geva et al. answered this by projecting value vectors through the unembedding matrix {% cite "geva2022concepts" %}.

Recall that the model's output is computed by multiplying the final residual stream by the unembedding matrix $W_U$ to get logits over the vocabulary. Because the MLP output is added to the residual stream, and $W_U$ is a linear map, each value vector $\mathbf{v}_i$ has a direct effect on the output logits:

$$
\Delta \text{logits}_i = \sigma(\mathbf{k}_i \cdot \mathbf{x}) \; \mathbf{v}_i \cdot W_U
$$

This projection gives a vector of vocabulary-logit effects for each neuron. We can inspect which tokens neuron $i$ directly promotes or suppresses before accounting for later layers and the final normalization.

The token representation x receives an additive update (A) from the FFN layer. Before the update, x can be interpreted as a distribution over vocabulary (B, showing words like 'few', 'pancake', 'coffee'). The FFN's update decomposes into sub-updates from value vectors v_1, v_2, ..., v_dm (C), each promoting a concept like breakfast foods (D, showing 'fruit, apples, snack, vitamins, berries, oats, yogurt, tea').">
  <figcaption>How MLP value vectors promote concepts. The token representation (B) receives an additive update (A) from the FFN layer. This update decomposes into sub-updates from individual value vectors (C), each promoting an interpretable concept in vocabulary space (D). From Geva et al., <em>Transformer Feed-Forward Layers Build Predictions by Promoting Concepts in the Vocabulary Space</em>. {%- cite "geva2022concepts" -%}</figcaption>
</figure>

Geva et al. found many value-vector projections whose highest-scoring tokens shared a recognizable theme {% cite "geva2022concepts" %}. A vector might promote {Paris, France, French, European, Seine}, or {multiply, divide, arithmetic, calculate}. These examples motivate a concept-promotion interpretation, but not every neuron yields one clean theme, and the projected write is only its direct effect on logits.

This yields a useful two-part description of an MLP neuron: its input weights and nonlinearity determine when it activates, while its output vector determines what it writes. The MLP output decomposes into per-neuron sub-updates:

$$
\text{MLP}(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{d_m} m_i \, \mathbf{v}_i
$$

where $m_i = \sigma(\mathbf{k}_i \cdot \mathbf{x})$ is the activation coefficient for neuron $i$. Each active neuron adds a scaled output direction. Projecting those writes into vocabulary space can suggest what they directly favor, while their downstream causal effects may differ because later components read the combined state.{% sidenote "The additive structure permits direct logit attribution at neuron granularity for a fixed pass. It does not make neurons independent: changing one activation can alter later attention, MLP, and normalization computations." %}

Roughly 68% of MLP outputs represent *compositional* predictions: the resulting top tokens differ from what any single neuron would promote on its own {% cite "geva2021kvmemories" %}. The neurons collaborate. No single neuron encodes "predict Paris." Instead, several neurons promote overlapping aspects (European places, capital cities, French things), and their combined signal converges on "Paris."

## Knowledge Neurons

If individual MLP neurons promote specific concepts, can we find the neurons responsible for specific facts? Dai et al. investigated this using integrated gradients on BERT's fill-in-the-blank task {% cite "dai2022knowledge" %}.

> **Knowledge Neuron:** A knowledge neuron is an MLP neuron whose activation is causally linked to a specific factual association. Suppressing it degrades the model's ability to express the fact; amplifying it strengthens the expression.

The results were sharp. Suppressing the top knowledge neurons for a given fact reduced the model's probability of producing the correct answer by 29% on average, while suppressing a random set of neurons of the same size had only a 1.5% effect. Amplifying knowledge neurons boosted the correct probability by 31% {% cite "dai2022knowledge" %}.{% sidenote "The knowledge neurons work studied BERT, an encoder-only model, using its fill-in-the-blank (masked language modeling) task. The findings about specific neurons controlling specific facts have been broadly validated in autoregressive models as well, though the details of which layers and neurons matter differ between architectures." %}

These interventions show that the selected neurons participate causally in producing the tested facts. They do not show that a fact lives in one neuron or one layer: correlated neurons, distributed representations, and parallel retrieval paths can all contribute to the same answer.

## The Factual Recall Pipeline

The studies above explain what individual MLP neurons do, but factual recall in a full transformer is not a single-step lookup. When the model processes "The Eiffel Tower is located in ___" and predicts "Paris," information must flow from the subject tokens ("Eiffel Tower") through the network to the prediction position. How is this orchestrated?

Geva et al. traced this pipeline end-to-end and identified three stages {% cite "geva2023factual" %}:

<figure>
  <img src="/topics/mlps-in-transformers/images/factual_recall_pipeline.png" alt="Three-stage factual recall pipeline for the query 'Beats Music is owned by ___'. Stage A (Subject enrichment): early MLP layers at the subject token 'Music' enrich its representation with attributes. Stage B (Relation propagation): attention heads propagate the relation 'is owned by' to the prediction position. Stage C (Attribute extraction): late attention heads extract the answer 'Apple' from the enriched subject representation.">
  <figcaption>The three-stage factual recall pipeline.

Green hexagons are MLP layers; purple arrows are attention heads. From Geva et al., <em>Dissecting Recall of Factual Associations in Auto-Regressive Language Models</em>. {%- cite "geva2023factual" -%}</figcaption>
</figure>

**Stage 1: Subject enrichment (early MLP layers).** At the position of the subject tokens ("Eiffel Tower"), early MLP layers enrich the representation with multiple attributes associated with the subject. After these layers, the residual stream at the subject position encodes not just the identity of the entity but a bundle of associated properties: location (Paris, France), type (landmark, tower), material (iron), and more. The MLP neurons doing this work are exactly the key-value memories described above: their keys match the subject pattern, and their values inject associated attributes.

**Stage 2: Relation propagation (attention in middle layers).** The relation tokens ("is located in") signal what kind of attribute is being queried. Attention heads in the middle layers propagate this relational signal to the final prediction position, setting up the query that will extract the answer. After this stage, the residual stream at the prediction position contains information about both the subject and the relation.

**Stage 3: Attribute extraction (late attention heads).** Attention heads at the prediction position attend back to the enriched subject representation and extract the specific attribute that matches the relation. These late attention heads effectively look up "the location attribute of the entity at the subject position" and write the answer ("Paris") to the prediction position, where it boosts the correct token's logit.{% sidenote "The three-stage pipeline is a useful simplification. In practice, the boundaries between stages are not sharp, and some information flows through parallel pathways. But the core insight holds: early MLPs enrich subjects with attributes, and later attention heads extract the relevant attribute based on the relation." %}

<details class="pause-and-think">
<summary>Pause and think: Why ROME targets mid-layer MLPs</summary>

[ROME](/topics/fact-editing/) edits factual associations by performing a rank-one update to a specific MLP layer's weight matrix. The technique targets mid-layer MLPs, not early layers, not late layers, and not attention heads. Given the three-stage factual recall pipeline, why would mid-layer MLPs be the right target?

Mid-layer MLPs sit at the boundary between subject enrichment and relation propagation. They are the last point where the model writes subject-associated attributes before attention heads begin extracting them. Editing the MLP at this stage modifies what attributes are available for extraction. Editing earlier layers would affect the raw subject representation (potentially disrupting many facts), and editing later layers would miss the window before extraction begins. This is the mechanistic justification for causal tracing's finding that mid-layer MLP restorations most strongly recover factual predictions.

</details>

## Connections Across the Course

The MLP-as-knowledge-storage view connects to several techniques covered elsewhere in the curriculum:

**Logit lens.** The [logit lens](/topics/logit-lens-and-tuned-lens/) projects intermediate residual streams into vocabulary space, revealing how predictions evolve layer by layer. The gradual refinement it reveals (e.g., "France" at layer 4 transitioning to "Paris" at layer 6) is a direct consequence of successive MLP layers promoting increasingly specific concepts. Each MLP layer adds its value-vector contributions, and the vocabulary-space projection shows the cumulative effect.

**Direct logit attribution.** [DLA](/topics/direct-logit-attribution/) decomposes the output into per-component contributions. The MLP terms in that decomposition ($\mathbf{r}^{\text{MLP}_l} \cdot W_U$) are exactly the summed value-vector contributions from layer $l$. Understanding that MLPs promote concepts explains *why* individual MLP layers often have strong, interpretable DLA signatures.

**Transcoders.** [Transcoders](/topics/transcoders/) replace opaque MLP layers with sparse, interpretable alternatives. The motivation for transcoders becomes clearer with the key-value memory picture: if we already know that MLP neurons detect patterns and promote concepts, a transcoder makes these patterns and concepts explicit and traceable through the circuit. Transcoders decompose the same computation that the key-value view describes, but in a form that supports circuit analysis.

**Model editing.** [ROME](/topics/fact-editing/) treats the MLP as a key-value memory and edits facts by modifying the value associated with a subject's key. The three-stage pipeline explains why this targets specific layers and why the editing has limitations: editing one MLP layer changes the attributes available at that layer, but earlier and later layers may still encode the original fact through redundant pathways.

## Limitations

The key-value memory view, while productive, has important caveats.

**Individual neurons are not the whole story.** The clean "one neuron, one concept" picture holds for some neurons but not all. Many neurons are polysemantic, responding to multiple unrelated patterns. The key-value memory interpretation works best for neurons with clear, monosemantic keys. [Superposition](/topics/superposition/) means that the true units of analysis may be directions in activation space, not individual neurons, which is part of why [sparse autoencoders](/topics/sparse-autoencoders/) exist.

**The three-stage pipeline is a simplification.** Factual recall involves parallel pathways, redundant encoding, and interactions between attention and MLPs that the clean three-stage story glosses over. Different facts may follow different retrieval pathways, and the boundaries between stages are not sharp.

**Causation is hard to establish.** Observing that a value vector promotes "Paris" in vocabulary space does not prove that the neuron is causally responsible for the model predicting "Paris" on a given input. Many neurons promote overlapping concepts, and the prediction emerges from their combination. Causal methods like [activation patching](/topics/activation-patching/) remain necessary to confirm which neurons actually matter for specific predictions.

## Looking Ahead

We now have a mechanistic picture of both components in a transformer layer. Attention moves information between positions. MLPs process that information at each position through key-value memories that promote concepts in vocabulary space. Together, they implement a staged pipeline for tasks like factual recall: MLPs enrich representations with associated attributes, and attention heads route and extract the relevant information.

The next article, [Layer Normalization](/topics/layer-normalization/), covers the normalization step that appears before each sublayer and why it introduces a nonlinearity that complicates the clean additive decomposition we rely on for mechanistic analysis.
