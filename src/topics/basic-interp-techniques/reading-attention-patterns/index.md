exitCriteria:
  - task: "Two heads produce nearly identical attention heatmaps on the same prompt. One copies the attended token's identity; the other writes the negative of its unembedding direction. Say what the heatmaps show, what they cannot show, and what you would inspect instead."
    answer: |
      The heatmaps show the output of the QK circuit — the routing decision, $\alpha_{i,j}$, which is where each destination position reads from. Identical heatmaps mean the two heads made the same routing decision, and nothing more.

      What they cannot show is the OV circuit, which decides what the read produces. Attention weight is a *coefficient* on a value vector; the vector itself is computed by an entirely separate pathway that never touches the pattern. A copying head and a suppressing head are the same picture.

      What to inspect: the head's actual output vector at the destination position, projected onto the logit direction you care about — the copying head projects positive, the suppressor negative. At the weight level, the end-to-end OV matrix $W_E W_{OV}^h W_U$ distinguishes them structurally: copying shows a large positive diagonal, suppression a negative one. Then confirm with an ablation, since a weight-level pattern still has to matter on real inputs.
  - task: "You are handed an attention heatmap with no axis labels, from a tool that may have transposed it. Describe how to determine which axis is destination and which is source, using only the image."
    answer: |
      Find the blank triangle. Causal masking sets $\alpha_{i,j} = 0$ for every $j > i$, so exactly half the matrix is empty, and its orientation identifies the axes: destination positions can only read *backwards*, so the filled region is the one where the source index does not exceed the destination index.

      Concretely, with destination on the vertical axis and source on the horizontal (the usual convention), the lower-left triangle is filled and the upper-right is blank. If the image shows the opposite, the axes are transposed.

      This check is worth doing every time, because the failure it catches is silent. A diagonal is symmetric under transposition, so a previous-token head looks like a previous-token head either way — but a *vertical* stripe becomes a *horizontal* one, which turns "many positions read from position 0" into "position 0 reads from many positions." The second is impossible under causal masking, and a reader who has not checked the axes may not notice that they have just described something the architecture forbids.
  - task: "Separate evidence from hypothesis in the claim \"this head tracks syntactic dependencies.\" Write the evidence-level statement it should have been, and list what would have to be added to earn the original claim."
    answer: |
      **Evidence level:** "On this prompt, each row of the pattern places most of its weight on a single earlier column, and those columns coincide with the syntactic head of each word under a dependency parse." That is a description of the heatmap plus an alignment with an external annotation — checkable, and it commits to nothing about mechanism.

      **To earn "tracks syntactic dependencies" you would need:**

      1. **Generality.** The same alignment across many sentences, varied constructions, and ideally another language — not one example. A single prompt cannot distinguish a syntactic rule from a lexical coincidence.
      2. **A control that breaks the confound.** Syntactic heads correlate with position and with content. Test sentences where the syntactic head is *not* the nearby or semantically obvious token, and see whether attention follows syntax or the confound.
      3. **The OV circuit.** Routing to the syntactic head is not tracking it unless something is moved. Show what the head writes when it attends there.
      4. **An intervention.** Ablate or patch the head and show that a behavior depending on that dependency changes.

      The general rule: a heatmap licenses a claim about where a head reads on the inputs you tested. Every stronger word — tracks, computes, represents, understands — is a promissory note that an experiment has to pay.

## Attention Pattern Visualization

An attention pattern is a matrix with one row for each destination position and one column for each source position. Cell $(i,j)$ contains the weight $\alpha_{i,j}$: how much the head at position $i$ reads from position $j$. Plotting this matrix as a heatmap turns a large table of numbers into shapes we can recognize.

> **Attention Pattern:** The matrix of normalized attention weights for one head. Row $i$ shows how the destination at position $i$ distributes its read across source positions $j$.

Check the axis labels before interpreting any heatmap. Some tools transpose the display, so a diagonal still looks like a diagonal while a vertical stripe becomes horizontal. Causal masking should leave the forbidden half of the matrix blank; that is a quick way to confirm which axis is which.

Consider GPT-2 Small processing a repeated sequence: "The cat sat on the mat. The cat sat on the." Two heads display distinctive patterns:

![Previous token head attention pattern showing a clear diagonal line where each position attends to the position immediately before it.](/topics/reading-attention-patterns/images/attn_prev_token.png "Figure 1: Previous token head (Layer 0, Head 1) in GPT-2 Small. The strong diagonal pattern shows each token attending to its immediate predecessor.")

![Induction head attention pattern showing off-diagonal attention where repeated tokens attend to tokens that followed their first occurrence.](/topics/reading-attention-patterns/images/attn_induction.png "Figure 2: Induction head (Layer 5, Head 1) in GPT-2 Small. In the second half of the sequence, attention jumps to specific positions in the first half, attending to tokens that followed the first occurrence of each repeated token.")

The first pattern is a **previous-token head** (Layer 0, Head 1): a diagonal displaced by one position. For each destination token, the largest weight falls on the source immediately before it. This head can implement the first step of an [induction circuit](/topics/induction-heads/) if its OV circuit writes the previous token's identity into the residual stream.

The second pattern is an **induction head** (Layer 5, Head 1): positions in the repeated half attend to positions in the first half. At the second “The,” for example, the head reads from “ cat,” the token that followed the first “The.” Its attention is consistent with the rule “find an earlier copy of the current token and read what came next.”{% sidenote "These patterns come from GPT-2 Small runs in TransformerLens, not idealized diagrams. The background attention is part of the data. Head labels summarize a dominant pattern; they do not claim that every attention weight follows the rule." %}

Together, the plots suggest the routing pattern required for induction. They do not establish the full mechanism. The query-key (QK) circuit produces the weights, while the output-value (OV) circuit determines what reading from a source position writes back. Two heads can have nearly identical heatmaps and opposite effects on the logits.

## Reading a Pattern Without Overreading It

Start with a plain description of the geometry: “each row peaks one column to the left” is evidence; “this head tracks syntax” is already a hypothesis. Then test whether the pattern persists across varied inputs. A head that looks like a previous-token head on one sentence may behave differently around punctuation, at the beginning of a sequence, or in another language.

Next inspect the OV circuit or the head's output. High attention weight gives a source value a large coefficient; it does not tell us whether that value is large, informative, or useful downstream. A head can attend sharply and write almost nothing, or spread attention across values that add coherently.

Finally, intervene. [Activation patching](/topics/activation-patching/) can test whether changing this head or its pattern changes the behavior of interest. Ablating the head, freezing its attention pattern, and patching its value output ask different questions, so the intervention should match the proposed mechanism.

<details class="pause-and-think">
<summary>Pause and think: the same pattern, a different function</summary>

Suppose two heads both attend almost entirely to the previous token. One head's OV circuit copies token identity; the other's writes the negative of that token's unembedding direction. What would their heatmaps tell you? What would you need to inspect to distinguish copying from suppression?

The heatmaps would look alike because they show only routing. Inspecting the heads' output vectors or OV circuits would reveal the difference, and an intervention could test whether those writes affect the predicted token.

## Looking Ahead

Attention heatmaps are useful hypothesis generators: they turn routing into something we can see. The [next block](/topics/activation-patching/) introduces interventions that test whether a visible pattern actually participates in the model's computation.
