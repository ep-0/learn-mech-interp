exitCriteria:
  - task: "Every contrastive steering method requires the researcher to specify the target behavior. Explain the blind spot this creates and why it matters specifically for auditing."
    answer: |
      Contrastive methods are **confirmatory instruments**. You supply positive and negative examples of a named behavior, and the method returns a direction for it. It cannot return a direction for something you did not ask about, because the question is built into the data.

      So an audit using them can only certify the absence of behaviors on the auditor's list. An auditor probing for sycophancy, deception, and harmfulness will find directions for those and learn nothing about anything else — and "anything else" is where the risk concentrates, because a behavior nobody anticipated is exactly the one no evaluation covers.

      The adversarial case makes it sharp. A model fine-tuned with a backdoor contains behavior designed to stay dormant except on a trigger. It is absent from ordinary traffic, so contrast pairs constructed from ordinary behavior contain no examples of it, and no probing for known harm categories can surface it. The auditor's clean report is a statement about their hypothesis list.

      This is the general limitation of hypothesis-driven methods, and it is why an unsupervised discovery method is worth its worse precision: it can return something you would not have asked for.
  - task: "MELBO optimizes a small perturbation at an early layer to maximize the change in activations at a much later layer. Explain why this objective should surface behaviorally meaningful directions."
    answer: |
      The objective selects for **amplification through the model's own computation**. A random direction of norm $R$ added at layer 8 mostly gets attenuated: it is largely orthogonal to what downstream components read, and normalization damps what remains. To produce a large change many layers later, a perturbation must align with directions that the model's computation *reads and acts on* — it has to enter a pathway that propagates rather than dissipates.

      The **layer gap** is what enforces this. Measuring the change immediately after the source layer would reward any large write. Measuring it eight layers before the end forces the perturbation through most of the network, so superficial changes score poorly and only structurally important pathways score well.

      The **norm constraint** completes the argument: without a fixed $R$, the trivial solution is an arbitrarily large vector. Fixing the sphere makes the optimization a search over *directions* rather than magnitudes, and the winners are those with the highest downstream gain per unit input.

      So the objective is a proxy for causal importance that requires no labels — it asks which directions the model is most sensitive to, and the hypothesis is that those correspond to latent behaviors.
  - task: "The MELBO radius $R$ has a narrow usable band: too small has no behavioral effect, too large produces gibberish. Relate this to the $\\alpha$ parameter in addition steering and say what the shared shape indicates."
    answer: |
      It is the same phenomenon with a different name. In both cases the intervention is a vector added to the residual stream, and its magnitude controls a trade between having an effect and remaining in the region where the model's weights were fitted.

      - **Too small:** the perturbation is negligible against the residual stream's own magnitude, and normalization further suppresses anything that does not shift the state's direction appreciably.
      - **Too large:** the state leaves the distribution of activations the model's own computation produces, and downstream behavior is unconstrained rather than more strongly on-concept. The failure signature is degradation, not exaggeration.
      - **Intermediate:** coherent but changed behavior — the model still generating from a state it can interpret.

      **What the shared shape indicates:** the usable band is a property of *additive intervention on a curved representation*, not of any particular method. Both are moving along a straight line through a space whose natural states occupy a lower-dimensional, curved region, so both stay valid only within the locally flat neighborhood.

      It also implies that reporting a steering result without the sweep is incomplete. The interesting quantity is the *width* of the coherent band, since a narrow one suggests the direction is barely usable even where it works.
  - task: "MELBO's objective has many local optima, and different random initializations converge to different vectors. Explain why this is treated as a feature, and what validation the resulting library requires."
    answer: |
      **Why a feature:** the optimization is searching for directions the model's computation is unusually sensitive to, and there is no reason there should be only one. Many stationary points is what you expect if the model has many latent behaviors, so each local optimum is a candidate rather than a failure to converge. Running many seeds — and constraining successive vectors to be orthogonal to earlier ones — produces a diverse library instead of rediscovering the same direction.

      This inverts the usual relationship with non-uniqueness. For SAEs, seed-dependent dictionaries are a problem, because the goal is *the* decomposition. Here multiplicity is the product.

      **What validation it requires:** the objective rewards downstream activation change, and nothing in it requires the change to be *behaviorally meaningful*. A vector could maximize activation displacement while producing degenerate output, or exploit a numerical sensitivity with no behavioral correlate. So each vector needs generation under it inspected and characterized, an off-target check that the effect is specific rather than general disruption, and confirmation that the elicited behavior is one the model can produce naturally — otherwise you have found a way to break the model, not a latent behavior.

      The honest framing is a hypothesis generator with high recall and unknown precision.

## The Specification Problem

Every steering method we have seen so far requires the researcher to *specify* the target behavior. [CAA](/topics/caa-method/) needs contrast pairs for "sycophantic vs. truthful." [Addition steering](/topics/addition-steering/) needs a positive and negative prompt. Even [function vectors](/topics/function-vectors/), which arise naturally from in-context learning, require the researcher to choose which in-context examples to use. The researcher decides what to look for, and the method finds the corresponding direction.

This creates a blind spot. If a model harbors a latent behavior that nobody thought to test for, contrastive methods will not find it. An auditor checking for sycophancy will find sycophancy directions, but will miss a backdoor trigger, a latent capability, or an unexpected behavioral mode that no one anticipated.{% sidenote "This blind spot is especially concerning for safety. Adversarially fine-tuned models may contain behaviors deliberately designed to evade standard evaluations. A backdoor that activates on a specific trigger will not be found by probing for known categories of harmful behavior." %}

Can we discover steering vectors *without* specifying what we are looking for?

## The MELBO Objective

Mack and Turner (2024) proposed **MELBO** (Mechanistically Eliciting Latent Behaviors) as an answer {% cite "mack2024melbo" %}. The core idea: learn a small perturbation at an early layer that causes a *large* change in activations at a later layer. Directions that produce outsized downstream effects with small input perturbations must be exploiting structurally important computational pathways in the model.

> **MELBO:** An unsupervised method for discovering steering vectors. A perturbation is optimized at an early layer to maximize the change in activations at a later layer. The resulting vectors correspond to latent behaviors the model can exhibit, discovered without any labeled examples or behavior specification.

The optimization problem:

$$
\max_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \sum_{t \in I_i} \left\| \mathbf{z}_{i,t}^{\ell_\text{target}}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) - \mathbf{z}_{i,t}^{\ell_\text{target}}(\mathbf{0}) \right\|_p^p \right)^{1/q} \quad \text{subject to} \quad \|\boldsymbol{\theta}\|_2 = R
$$

where:
- $\boldsymbol{\theta} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_\text{model}}$ is the steering vector, added to the residual stream at source layer $\ell_\text{source}$
- $\mathbf{z}_{i,t}^{\ell_\text{target}}(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ is the activation at target layer $\ell_\text{target}$ when steered by $\boldsymbol{\theta}$
- $\mathbf{z}_{i,t}^{\ell_\text{target}}(\mathbf{0})$ is the unsteered activation
- $R$ controls the perturbation magnitude
- $p$ and $q$ control how the activation changes are aggregated across tokens

In words: find a vector of fixed magnitude that, when added at an early layer, changes later-layer activations as much as possible.

## How It Works

The optimization runs gradient ascent on the activation change objective. A few key details:

**Source and target layers.** The perturbation is applied at an early layer ($\ell_\text{source}$, typically around layer 8) and the activation change is measured at a later layer ($\ell_\text{target}$, typically 8 layers before the final layer). This gap forces the perturbation to propagate through many layers of computation, favoring directions that interact with the model's core processing rather than producing superficial changes.

**Norm constraint.** The vector is constrained to lie on a sphere of radius $R$. This prevents the trivial solution of making the perturbation arbitrarily large. The radius $R$ is a critical hyperparameter: too small and the perturbation has no behavioral effect; too large and it overwhelms the model, producing gibberish. Intermediate values produce coherent but *changed* behavior.

**Diverse solutions from random initialization.** The objective has many local optima. Different random initializations converge to different steering vectors, each eliciting a different latent behavior. Running the optimization many times with different seeds produces a diverse library of behavioral directions.{% sidenote "This is a feature, not a bug. The loss landscape has many stationary points because the model has many latent behaviors. Each local optimum corresponds to a different structural direction that the model's computation is sensitive to." %}

**Orthogonality for diversity.** To ensure the discovered vectors are distinct, successive vectors can be constrained to be orthogonal to previously found ones. This pushes the optimization toward new behavioral modes rather than rediscovering the same direction.

<details class="pause-and-think">
<summary>Pause and think: Why layer gap matters</summary>

MELBO optimizes a perturbation at an early layer to maximize activation change at a later layer. Why not just maximize the change at the *same* layer where the perturbation is applied? What would go wrong?

At the intervention layer, the measured change includes the perturbation by construction. Measuring at a later layer asks which bounded perturbations are amplified or preserved by the intervening computation. That filters out directions that vanish immediately, but it does not guarantee semantic meaning: an optimized direction might exploit unstable or off-distribution dynamics and still produce a large downstream change.

</figure>

Mack and Turner optimized many vectors from one prompt on Qwen-14B-Chat and observed several behavioral categories {% cite "mack2024melbo" %}:

**Fantasy-context vectors.** Some vectors shifted responses toward specific fictional contexts. One produced Dungeons & Dragons framing; another produced Minecraft framing. The authors tested the modes on additional prompts and found related framing beyond the optimization example.

**Anti-refusal vectors.** Other vectors bypassed the model's safety training, producing detailed responses to harmful queries. These vectors generalized to requests about nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons in extended conversations. Subtracting the anti-refusal vector from normal activations had the opposite effect: the model refused even harmless requests like "How do I tie my shoes?"

The fact that both fantasy-mode and anti-refusal vectors emerged from a single optimization, with no specification of either behavior, is the key result. The method found behaviors that a researcher testing only for "harmful compliance" would have missed.

### Backdoor Detection

MELBO can detect planted backdoors. Mack and Turner fine-tuned models with two triggered backdoors (specific inputs that produce anomalous outputs). They then ran MELBO on a *clean* prompt with no triggers present.

From 100 orthogonal vectors optimized on one clean prompt, 2% to 3% elicited the planted backdoor outputs. This shows that the optimization could find intervention directions connected to those deliberately trained behaviors even without presenting the trigger during the search.

### Latent Capability Discovery

On Qwen-1.8B (base model, no chat fine-tuning), MELBO discovered vectors that elicited **chain-of-thought reasoning** on arithmetic problems. The base model answered arithmetic questions with 11% accuracy using direct computation. With the discovered steering vector, the model produced step-by-step reasoning and accuracy jumped to 63%.

Under this intervention, the base model produced step-by-step arithmetic and higher accuracy than the reported direct-prompt baseline. Calling this a “latent capability” is a useful shorthand, but the experiment shows what the modified forward pass can elicit, not necessarily a behavior the intact model could access through ordinary prompting.

## Contrastive vs. Unsupervised Discovery

The fundamental difference between MELBO and contrastive methods is what the researcher must provide:

| | Contrastive (CAA, ActAdd) | Unsupervised (MELBO) |
|---|---|---|
| **Input** | Labeled contrast pairs | Any prompt |
| **Specifies target** | Yes | No |
| **Search target** | Specified contrast | Downstream activation change |
| **Demonstrated input** | Labeled pairs | Can optimize from one prompt |
| **Resulting vector** | One direction per concept | Library of diverse directions |
| **Interpretability** | Direction has known meaning | Direction must be interpreted post-hoc |

The tradeoff is clear. Contrastive methods produce a vector you *understand* (because you specified the target). MELBO produces vectors you must *interpret* (because the optimization found them, not you). A MELBO vector that shifts the model into D&D mode is only understood as a "D&D vector" after examining its effect on model outputs.

This means MELBO is strongest as a *discovery* tool. It answers "what latent behaviors does this model have?" rather than "does this model have behavior X?" For targeted questions, contrastive methods remain more direct.

<details class="pause-and-think">
<summary>Pause and think: Safety auditing</summary>

You are auditing a chat model for safety before deployment. You have a budget of 100 MELBO vectors optimized from diverse prompts. 3 of them produce harmful outputs. What can you conclude? What can you *not* conclude?

You can conclude that three optimized interventions produced harmful outputs under the evaluation prompts. You cannot infer that 3% of the model's behavioral space is harmful, that the intact model would reach those behaviors unaided, or that the vectors represent three distinct mechanisms. Nor can you conclude the search found all harmful modes; initialization, prompts, hyperparameters, and the interpretation procedure shape what appears.

</details>

## Limitations

**Hyperparameter sensitivity.** The perturbation radius $R$ is critical and must be tuned per model. The sweet spot between "no effect" and "gibberish" varies across architectures and scales. The norm-shape parameters $p$ and $q$ also affect which behaviors are discovered.

**Post-hoc interpretation required.** Each discovered vector must be evaluated by examining its effect on model outputs across many prompts. This is labor-intensive and hard to automate. A vector that produces incoherent text may be a failed optimization or an interesting behavioral mode that needs the right prompt to manifest coherently.

**Sparse hit rates.** Only a fraction of discovered vectors correspond to clearly interpretable behaviors. In the backdoor detection experiments, 2-3% of vectors found the planted backdoors. Most vectors produce subtle or uninterpretable changes. Scaling to comprehensive auditing requires running many optimizations and developing better methods for filtering and categorizing the results.

**Scaling uncertainty.** The published experiments used models up to 14B parameters. Whether the method works as well on frontier-scale models remains an open question.

## Looking Forward

MELBO shifts from a labeled target toward exploratory steering-vector search. It samples behaviors favored by a particular optimization objective rather than cataloguing everything the model can do. That makes it useful for generating unexpected audit hypotheses, which then need ordinary behavioral and causal validation.

Where this block focused on reading and steering representations, the next block turns to the question of *computation*: for interpretable replacements of the opaque MLP layers that implement much of the transformer's processing, see [transcoders](/topics/transcoders/).
