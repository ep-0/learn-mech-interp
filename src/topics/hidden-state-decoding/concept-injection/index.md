glossary:
  - term: "Concept Injection"
    definition: "A causal test for self-report that adds an activation direction associated with a known concept while a model answers a question about its internal state."
  - term: "Grounded Self-Report"
    definition: "A description of an internal state that changes when that state is intervened on, rather than following only from the prompt, prior beliefs, or sampled output."

exitCriteria:
  - task: "Concept injection reverses the SelfIE experiment. State what reversing it buys, and why a known target is what makes the self-report checkable."
    answer: |
      SelfIE starts with an activation of uncertain meaning and asks the model to decode it. The answer cannot be scored, because there is no ground truth — a fluent description is consistent with genuine decoding and with a plausible guess from the prompt.

      Concept injection starts from the other end: build a direction for a **known** concept, add it, and ask whether the model notices. Now there is a target. The self-report can be compared against what was injected, so the experiment produces a right-or-wrong outcome rather than a description requiring judgment.

      What this buys is a **causal link that ordinary prompting cannot provide**. Asking a model whether it is thinking about bread gets an answer, and nothing distinguishes an introspective report from a confabulated one, because both are just text conditioned on the question. Injecting the concept and observing that the self-report changes with the intervention makes the internal state a manipulated variable rather than an inferred one.

      The claim stays narrow, and deliberately so: a functional capacity to report *some* internal states, tested on directions the experimenter constructed. Not general self-understanding, and not a claim about experience.
  - task: "The concept vector is built as $\\mathbf{h}_{c,l}$ minus the mean over other concepts, rather than as a raw activation. Say why the subtraction is necessary."
    answer: |
      A raw activation $\mathbf{h}_{c,l}$ from the prompt "Tell me about $c$" contains far more than the concept. It carries the prompt's template structure, the instruction-following state, position information, and whatever the model represents about being asked a question at all — components shared by *every* prompt of this form.

      Adding that raw vector would inject all of it. The model's state would be shifted along many dimensions that have nothing to do with $c$, and any change in behavior would be unattributable.

      Subtracting the mean over other concepts cancels everything common to the prompt family, because those components appear identically in $\mathbf{h}_{c,l}$ and in the average. What survives is the part specific to $c$.

      This is the CAA construction with a many-way contrast rather than a pair: the "negative" class is every other concept rather than one chosen opposite, which makes the residual less likely to encode an arbitrary axis between two particular concepts.

      It also fixes what the injection *means*, which the experiment needs. Without it, a positive result could be the model detecting any of the shared components, and the concept identification in the self-report would be the only evidence tying the effect to $c$.
  - task: "A successful trial requires the model to report detecting something unusual *before* naming the injected concept. Explain why the ordering is the crux of the experiment."
    answer: |
      Because ordinary activation steering already predicts that the concept word appears. Inject a bread direction and the model becomes more likely to emit bread-related tokens — that is what steering does, and it involves no introspection whatsoever. A response containing the injected concept is therefore uninformative on its own.

      What steering does *not* predict is a report about the model's own internal state: "I notice something unusual in my processing." That is a claim about a detected anomaly, not an expression of the concept, and it requires the model to have some read on its own activations rather than merely being pushed by them.

      The ordering makes the two separable. Detection first, identification second, matches an introspective account — notice the intrusion, then characterize it. Identification alone, or the concept leaking into the text before any acknowledgment, matches the steering account.

      This also constrains the injection strength. Too large an $\alpha$ and the concept dominates generation, producing the word mechanically and destroying the distinction the experiment rests on. The usable regime has to change the internal state enough to be detectable and little enough that reporting it remains a choice.

## From Readout to Causal Test

[SelfIE](/topics/selfie-interpretation/) starts with an activation whose meaning is uncertain and asks the model to decode it. A fluent answer does not establish that the model inspected the activation. The answer could follow from the prompt, visible context, or a plausible guess.

Lindsey {% cite "lindsey2025introspection" %} reverses the experiment. Start with a direction chosen to represent a known concept, add it to the model's residual stream, and ask whether the model notices the resulting internal change. The known intervention provides a target against which the self-report can be checked.

> **Concept injection:** Adding an activation direction associated with a known concept while a model answers a question about its internal state. If the self-report changes with the intervention, the experiment establishes a causal link that ordinary prompting cannot provide.

The claim is narrower than general self-understanding. A model might learn to detect a few unusual activation patterns without being able to inspect arbitrary computations. The experiments test a functional capacity to report some current or prior internal states, not consciousness or subjective experience.

## Constructing the Intervention

For a concept $c$, the experiment records the layer-$l$ activation elicited just before a response to "Tell me about $c$." It subtracts the mean activation from otherwise identical prompts about other concepts:

$$
\mathbf{v}_{c,l}
=
\mathbf{h}_{c,l}
-
\frac{1}{|\mathcal{C} \setminus \{c\}|}
\sum_{c' \in \mathcal{C} \setminus \{c\}}
\mathbf{h}_{c',l}
$$

During the introspection prompt, this concept vector is added at the same layer from the final prompt token through the generated response:

$$
\mathbf{h}'_{t,l} = \mathbf{h}_{t,l} + \alpha \mathbf{v}_{c,l}
$$

The coefficient $\alpha$ controls injection strength. If it is too small, the state may be undetectable. If it is too large, the concept can dominate generation or make the response incoherent. A useful regime has to change the internal state without reducing the task to mechanically emitting the injected word.

A successful trial must separate detection from ordinary steering. In the following figure, the model first says that it detects something unusual and only then identifies the injected concept. Simply producing a concept-related word would also be expected from activation steering.

## What Counts as Grounded Self-Report?

The study separates four requirements that are easy to blur together:

1. **Accuracy.** The report correctly identifies the manipulated aspect of the internal state.
2. **Grounding.** The report causally depends on that state. Changing or removing the injection should change the report.
3. **Internality.** The causal path does not run only through the model's sampled output. Detection must occur before the model can infer the concept by reading its own concept-related words.
4. **Metacognitive representation.** The model registers a fact *about* its state, rather than merely translating the injected direction into the next related token.

Concept injection directly addresses grounding, and the order of the response helps test internality. A yes-or-no judgment about whether anything unusual is present also supplies indirect evidence for a metacognitive step. The experiment does not identify such a step mechanistically, so the fourth criterion remains the least established.

The evaluation counts a trial as successful only when the model affirms that it detects an injected state, identifies the concept, does so before mentioning concept-related content, and remains coherent. No-injection trials measure the false-positive rate. Unrelated yes-or-no questions test whether steering merely biases the model toward saying "yes," while random directions test whether any sufficiently large perturbation feels detectable.

## Results and Failure Modes

At the best layer and strength, Claude Opus 4.1 met the study's success criteria on roughly 20% of trials. The best layer was around two-thirds of the way through the model. Production-model control trials produced no false detections in 100 attempts, although some experimental model variants were less well calibrated. Random vectors needed a larger norm and were detected less often. These results demonstrate an unreliable capability in particular tested models, not a general property of language models {% cite "lindsey2025introspection" %}.

The model often reports no injection even though the concept visibly influences its later text. At excessive strength it becomes confused, incoherent, or makes elaborate claims about emotions and bodily sensations that the intervention cannot verify. In other trials it recognizes the concept only after saying it. That last case shows causal influence, but fails the internality test because the model could read the evidence from its own output. Failures remain the norm.

<details class="pause-and-think">
<summary>Pause and think: Detection or steering?</summary>

Suppose the model answers, "I am thinking about love," after a love direction is injected. Compare two mechanisms:

- The model detects an unusual state, recognizes it as love-related, and reports that observation.
- The prompt produces "I am thinking about," after which ordinary steering supplies the token "love."

Both produce the same sentence. What change to the prompt or scoring rule would distinguish them? The study's answer is to require evidence of detection before the concept appears, but that is still behavioral evidence rather than a located metacognitive circuit.

## Remembering a Prior Intention

A second experiment asks whether the model uses prior hidden states without an explicit request to inspect an injection. The model reads an unrelated sentence, then its answer is artificially prefilled with a random word such as "bread." On the next turn, it is asked whether it intended that answer or whether it was an accident. Without an intervention, the model usually disavows the prefill.

The experiment then retroactively adds the matching concept direction to activations *before* the prefilled response. As the figure shows, the model becomes more likely to accept "bread" as intentional even though the visible transcript is unchanged. Injecting an unrelated concept, or injecting the matching concept only after the prefill, does not produce the same effect {% cite "lindsey2025introspection" %}.

<figure>
  <img src="/topics/concept-injection/images/prefill-intention.png" alt="Prefill intention experiment. The model normally says a forced response containing bread was accidental, but accepts it as intended when a bread concept vector is injected into earlier activations.">
  <figcaption>Injecting a matching concept before a forced output changes whether the model later treats that output as intended. From Lindsey, <em>Emergent Introspective Awareness in Large Language Models</em>. {% cite "lindsey2025introspection" %}</figcaption>
</figure>

This result is consistent with a circuit that compares the previous output with a cached representation of what the model was about to say. Its most sensitive layer was earlier than the layer for direct concept detection, suggesting that the two behaviors need not share one general introspection mechanism. The intervention is artificial, the behavior is model-specific, and several simpler consistency-checking mechanisms could explain it. It is evidence for access to a prior internal representation, not evidence about subjective experience.

## What the Experiments Establish

Concept injection creates causal evidence in a synthetic setting. It shows that some tested models can sometimes report an internal perturbation before that perturbation becomes visible in their output. The prefill experiment further suggests that a model can compare sampled text with a representation computed on an earlier token.

The experiments do not validate every detail in a freeform self-report, identify the responsible circuitry, or show that the capability generalizes to ordinary computation. Layer, prompt, concept, and injection strength all matter. Narrow anomaly-detection or output-consistency mechanisms could explain the results without a general-purpose ability to inspect internal computation.

## Looking Ahead

Concept injection tests an existing reporting capability with a controlled intervention. The next article, [Training Models to Explain Their Computations](/topics/training-self-explanation/), asks what changes when the reporting interface is explicitly trained. It covers both explainers trained on interpretation targets and a shared adapter trained to report deliberately implanted behaviors.
