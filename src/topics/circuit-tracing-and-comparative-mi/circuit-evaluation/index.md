## Beyond Discovery

The [IOI circuit](/topics/ioi-circuit/) tells a compelling story: 26 heads in GPT-2 Small implement a three-step algorithm for identifying indirect objects. Duplicate Token Heads detect the repeated name, S-Inhibition Heads suppress it, and Name Mover Heads output the remaining name. But finding a circuit is only half the challenge. The harder question is: how do we know this account is *correct*?

A circuit hypothesis can fail in subtle ways. It might miss components that matter. It might include components that do not contribute. It might reproduce the right answer for the wrong reasons. Evaluating a circuit requires criteria that distinguish genuine mechanistic explanations from plausible-sounding narratives. Wang et al. proposed three such criteria {% cite "wang2022ioi" %}, and the IOI circuit itself reveals why evaluation is harder than it first appears.

## Negative Name Movers: Components That Work Against the Task

During direct logit attribution analysis, Wang et al. found something puzzling. Several heads in layers 10-11 have *negative* contributions to the logit difference. They push the model away from the correct answer (the indirect object) and toward the subject. These are the **Negative Name Mover Heads**, and they actively work against the circuit's task on individual examples.

Why would training produce heads that hurt performance? The leading hypothesis is **loss hedging**. Cross-entropy loss penalizes confident wrong predictions more harshly than uncertain correct ones. If the Name Movers sometimes make errors, Negative Name Movers reduce the confidence of those predictions, lowering the penalty.{% sidenote "Loss hedging is a statistical optimization, not an algorithmic one. The model's training objective is average cross-entropy loss across the entire training distribution, not accuracy on individual examples. Reducing prediction confidence on examples where the model might be wrong improves the expected loss, even though it slightly hurts performance on examples where the model is right." %}

The practical effect: ablating a Negative Name Mover actually *improves* IOI performance on individual examples. The model predicts the indirect object more confidently without the hedging. But this does not mean the model is better off without it, the hedging serves the training objective across the full distribution.

Negative Name Movers teach an important lesson: **circuits can contain components that appear counterproductive when viewed in isolation.** A head that hurts per-example performance may improve the model's expected loss across all training data. Naive DLA (which head helps most on this example?) can miss or misinterpret components whose function is distributional rather than per-example. Subsequent work has shown that Negative Name Movers are instances of a general [copy suppression](/topics/copy-suppression/) pattern: heads that attend to where a predicted token appears earlier in context and output the negative of that token's unembedding {% cite "mcdougall2023copy" %}. Copy suppression heads serve a calibration function across the full pre-training distribution, not just the IOI task.

## Backup Name Movers: Built-In Redundancy

Wang et al. made another surprising discovery during ablation experiments. When primary Name Mover Heads were ablated (outputs set to zero), the model's performance did not degrade as much as expected. Something was compensating.

Closer inspection revealed: certain heads that were nearly inactive in the normal circuit *activated* when the primary Name Movers were removed. These are the **Backup Name Mover Heads**. They have the same functional profile as regular Name Movers, they attend to name tokens, their OV circuits copy names to output logits, and they respond to S-Inhibition signals. But under normal operation, their attention weights are small and their contribution is minimal.{% sidenote "Backup Name Movers were discovered through an iterated ablation protocol: first ablate the primary Name Movers, then run DLA on the remaining heads. Previously quiet heads suddenly show large positive contributions. This is invisible under standard patching, since the backups do not activate unless the primaries are removed." %}

The discovery protocol illustrates the challenge:

1. Ablate the primary Name Mover Heads
2. Measure the logit difference, it drops, but not to zero
3. Run DLA on the remaining heads, previously quiet heads now show large positive contributions
4. These are the Backup Name Movers

Neural network redundancy has deep implications. The circuit can tolerate partial damage and still function. But it also means that standard [noising experiments](/topics/activation-patching/) underestimate the importance of primary components, because backups compensate silently. And it complicates the concept of "minimality", are backup components part of the circuit or not? This backup behavior is an instance of a general phenomenon called [self-repair](/topics/self-repair/): when a model component is ablated, later components compensate through multiple mechanisms, including LayerNorm rescaling and dormant backup heads {% cite "mcgrath2023hydra" %}.

<details class="pause-and-think">
<summary>Pause and think: The limits of standard ablation</summary>

Backup Name Movers are invisible under normal operation and only activate when primary Name Movers are ablated. What does this imply about our ability to find all components of a circuit using standard methods?

Standard ablation tests one component at a time, holding everything else fixed. But backup mechanisms only reveal themselves when specific primary components are removed. If we have not ablated the right combination of heads, the backups remain hidden. In principle, there could be backup mechanisms for other head classes (backup S-Inhibition Heads, backup Duplicate Token Heads) that have never been discovered because the right ablation combination was never tested. The number of possible ablation combinations grows exponentially, making exhaustive search infeasible. This is a fundamental limitation of current circuit analysis methods.

## The Expanded IOI Circuit Diagram

With all seven reported head classes included, we can inspect the expanded IOI circuit account:

1. **Previous Token Heads** (L0-1): shift token identity one position forward
2. **Duplicate Token Heads** (L0-1): detect same-token matches at S2
3. **Induction Heads** (L5-6): confirm the repeated name via K-composition
4. **S-Inhibition Heads** (L7-8): suppress Name Mover attention to the duplicated name
5. **Name Mover Heads** (L9-10): copy the attended name to output logits
6. **Negative Name Mover Heads** (L10-11): reduce prediction confidence (loss hedging)
7. **Backup Name Mover Heads**: dormant backups that activate when primary Name Movers fail

![The proposed IOI circuit diagram showing functional head classes and their connections](/topics/ioi-circuit/images/ioi_circuit_diagram.png "Figure 1: The proposed IOI circuit in GPT-2 Small, showing name movers, S-inhibition heads, duplicate token heads, induction heads, and their connections.")

The diagram shows information flowing top to bottom through the network. The detection stage (layers 0-6) identifies which name is duplicated. The suppression stage (layers 7-8) translates detection into inhibition. The output stage (layers 9-10) copies the surviving name. Negative Name Movers and Backup Name Movers add hedging and redundancy to the primary pathway.

## Evaluating Circuits: Three Criteria

Finding a circuit is a scientific claim: "these components implement this behavior." Like any scientific claim, it needs evaluation. Wang et al. proposed three criteria {% cite "wang2022ioi" %}:

> **Circuit Evaluation Criteria:** A circuit $C$ for a model $M$ on task $T$ should satisfy: *Faithfulness*, $C$ reproduces $M$'s behavior on $T$. *Completeness*, $C$ includes all components that matter for $T$. *Minimality*, $C$ includes no unnecessary components.

**Faithfulness** asks: does the circuit reproduce the full model's behavior? The test is to run the model with only the circuit components active (ablating everything else) and compare the output to the full model. The IOI circuit recovers approximately 87% of the full model's logit difference. This is good but not perfect, the remaining 13% comes from components outside the circuit, including MLPs and minor attention head contributions.

**Completeness** asks: does the circuit include everything that matters? The test is to ablate the circuit components (keeping everything else) and check if behavior collapses. Ablating the 26 IOI circuit heads reduces the logit difference dramatically, but not to zero. Some minor pathways outside the identified circuit also contribute. The circuit captures the primary mechanism but not every contributor.

**Minimality** asks whether a simpler subgraph explains the behavior just as well. Individual ablations are one test, but they are not decisive when components are redundant or interact. Backup Name Movers can compensate for primary Name Movers, while removing Negative Name Movers can improve the narrow task metric. The answer therefore depends on the behavior, distribution, and explanatory goal.

## The Tension Between Criteria

The three criteria pull in different directions. **Faithfulness vs. minimality**: adding components can improve behavioral agreement while making the account harder to interpret. The entire model is faithful to itself but is not a useful circuit explanation. **Completeness vs. minimality**: including backup mechanisms improves coverage but expands the graph. Whether backups count as part of “the circuit” depends on whether the target includes behavior under intervention.{% sidenote "This resembles a familiar tradeoff in scientific modeling. A detailed simulation may reproduce a system closely, while a simplified model may explain the regularity more clearly. Circuit analysis needs both predictive agreement and a useful level of abstraction." %}

There is no single right weighting of the criteria. They form a framework for stating what a circuit account preserves and omits, not a universal score. The IOI analysis reports about 87% faithfulness under its chosen evaluation and illustrates why completeness and minimality depend on definitions and interventions.

## Causal Scrubbing

The evaluation criteria described above are intuitive but informal. Can we do better? Chan et al. at Redwood Research proposed **causal scrubbing** as a formal method for testing circuit hypotheses {% cite "chan2022causalscrubbing" %}.

An interpretability hypothesis specifies which activations should be *interchangeable* without affecting behavior. Causal scrubbing tests that claim by resampling activations according to the hypothesis and checking whether behavior is preserved.

The procedure has three steps:

1. **Formalize the hypothesis** as a computational graph where each node specifies what a component computes and which inputs matter
2. **Resample activations** by replacing each node's activation with one sampled from a different input that matches the hypothesis about what that node computes
3. **Check behavior preservation**, if the model's output is preserved despite resampling, the hypothesis is consistent with the model's computation

For example, to test whether Name Mover Head 9.9 "copies whatever name it attends to, regardless of sentence structure," take two IOI sentences that differ in structure but have the same name attended by Head 9.9. Swap its activation between the sentences. If the output is preserved, the hypothesis about the head's function is consistent.

**Strengths.** Causal scrubbing is formal and principled, forcing hypotheses to be precise and falsifiable. It moves beyond ad-hoc evaluation (merely checking accuracy recovery) and was successfully applied to known circuits like induction heads and parenthesis matching.

**Limitations.** Causal scrubbing has well-documented shortcomings:

- **Simultaneously too strict and too permissive.** Useful but incomplete hypotheses may fail the test, while vague hypotheses can pass if they are not specific enough about what each node computes.
- **Cannot distinguish extensionally equivalent hypotheses.** If two different mechanistic stories produce the same input-output behavior, causal scrubbing treats them as equally valid. It tests behavior preservation, not mechanism identity.
- **Distribution-dependent.** Results are tied to the specific inputs used for testing. A hypothesis might pass on one prompt distribution and fail on another.
- **Difficulty with redundancy.** Backup mechanisms (like the IOI circuit's Backup Name Movers) break the assumption that components can be independently resampled. If component A is resampled but component B compensates, the hypothesis about A may incorrectly pass.

Redwood Research later described causal scrubbing as part of why its researchers moved away from that particular faithful-explanation agenda. This is evidence about one research program's assessment, not a theorem that rigorous circuit evaluation is impossible. It does highlight the cost of specifying and testing explanations at the required granularity.

<details class="pause-and-think">
<summary>Pause and think: Behavior preservation vs. mechanism identity</summary>

Causal scrubbing tests whether activations are interchangeable according to a hypothesis, but it cannot distinguish two hypotheses that make the same behavioral predictions. Is this a problem unique to causal scrubbing, or is it a fundamental limitation of any evaluation method based on behavior?

Any test limited to the same observable consequences cannot distinguish extensionally equivalent hypotheses. Investigators need either a more granular intervention or inputs on which the hypotheses predict different outcomes. This underdetermination is not specific to causal scrubbing.

## Lessons from the IOI Circuit

The IOI study taught the field several principles about how transformers compute:

**Compositional computation.** Different layers perform different steps of an algorithm, with information flowing between them through the residual stream. The detect-suppress-output structure is a genuine multi-step algorithm, not a single-step lookup.

**Useful functional groupings.** On the IOI prompt distribution, head classes support recognizable roles: Name Movers copy names, S-Inhibition Heads alter downstream attention, and Duplicate Token Heads respond to repeated names. Patching supplies causal evidence for the proposed paths, but the labels remain task-scoped summaries of polysemantic components.

**Learned structure.** The three-step account was not programmed by hand. It emerged during gradient-based training, showing that a learned computation can support a compact algorithmic description on a defined task distribution.

**Surprises.** Negative Name Movers show that circuits can contain components that work against the task for statistical reasons. Backup Name Movers show that models build redundancy into their circuits. Both properties were unexpected and required specialized experiments to discover.

## Limitations of Circuit Analysis

The IOI analysis is the best circuit analysis ever performed, and it still has significant limitations.

**Scale.** The analysis took months of researcher effort for one task in a small model (117M parameters). Manual circuit discovery does not scale to models with billions of parameters, even with semi-automated tools. **ACDC** (Automatic Circuit DisCovery) {% cite "conmy2023ioi" %} automates path patching by starting with a fully connected computational graph and recursively pruning edges whose activation patching effect falls below a threshold. It operates on *edges* (connections between components), not just nodes, producing a wiring diagram rather than a parts list. The process can be sped up significantly by using [attribution patching](/topics/attribution-patching/) as a fast screening step, reserving full activation patching for verification of the top candidates. Even so, ACDC requires defining a clean metric and a distribution of clean/corrupted input pairs, and the results depend on the pruning threshold.

**The decomposition problem.** The IOI circuit was tractable because the relevant features happened to align with individual attention heads. Each head class had a clear function. But this is not always the case. When features are distributed across many components, or when one head participates in multiple unrelated features, head-level circuit analysis breaks down.{% sidenote "The IOI circuit uses roughly 18% of GPT-2 Small's attention heads. The other 82% participate in other circuits for other tasks. Some may participate in multiple circuits simultaneously, making it impossible to assign a single functional role to each head." %}

**The decomposition problem.** [Superposition](/topics/superposition/) is one reason behaviorally relevant features need not align with individual neurons or heads. Polysemanticity can also arise because a component is reused across contexts. Feature-learning methods such as [sparse autoencoders](/topics/sparse-autoencoders/) offer a finer basis for circuit tracing, but introduce their own reconstruction and identification assumptions.

The IOI circuit remains an instructive case study because it pairs a readable algorithmic hypothesis with interventions and quantitative evaluation. Its incomplete faithfulness, ambiguous minimality, and labor-intensive discovery process are not footnotes; they show exactly what a circuit claim must report.
