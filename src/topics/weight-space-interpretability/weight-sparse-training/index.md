## Interpretability as a Training Constraint

Most techniques in this curriculum take the model as given. Someone else trained it; we arrive afterwards and look for structure. [Probes](/topics/probing-classifiers/), [sparse autoencoders (SAEs)](/topics/sparse-autoencoders/), [attribution graphs](/topics/circuit-tracing/), and the [parameter decomposition](/topics/parameter-decomposition/) of the previous two articles are all post hoc. They work with a model optimized for predictive loss, not for explanations that humans can easily read.

Many of them run into [superposition](/topics/superposition/): a dense network can represent more features than it has dimensions, leaving individual neurons or directions with mixed roles {% cite "elhage2022toy" %}. Decomposition methods then try to recover simpler units from those compressed representations. Weight-sparse training explores a different hypothesis: perhaps a larger network with very few nonzero connections can learn useful computations in a form that is easier to separate. Rather than reconstruct such a network after training, train it directly {% cite "gao2025weightsparse" %}.

## Forcing Most Weights to Zero

Force the vast majority of weights to be exactly zero. Not activations, and not experts: the weights themselves, so that each neuron has only a handful of connections. In the sparsest models roughly 1 in 1000 weights is nonzero.{% sidenote "This is the opposite of mixture-of-experts (MoE) sparsity, which in this terminology is weight-dense: an MoE model's weights are almost all nonzero, it just does not use all of them on every token. Here the weights are gone." %}

A neuron that reads only three residual channels cannot directly combine information spread across thirty of them, though earlier layers could still compress that information first. With few connections per neuron, distributed representations also consume scarce connectivity. The constraint does not forbid superposition, but it changes its cost and may encourage the model to place some concepts in more isolated channels.

After each AdamW step, everything in each weight matrix is zeroed except the largest-magnitude entries, keeping the same nonzero fraction in every matrix. The target sparsity is annealed in from fully dense over training. Mild activation sparsity is applied on top, about 1 in 4 activations nonzero. The models are GPT-2-style decoder-only transformers trained on Python code.

## Measuring Whether It Worked

A model counts as more interpretable here if each of its individual behaviors is implemented by a compact standalone circuit, on the reasoning that an untangled model should be easy to untangle.

A node is one neuron, one attention channel, one residual-channel read, or one residual-channel write: in weight matrices, these correspond to rows and columns. An edge is a single nonzero weight. Unlike a learned feature dictionary, this graph is stated directly in the model's own coordinates {% cite "gao2025weightsparse" %}. Researchers still have to decide which behavior to study and how to describe each component, but the numerical nodes and edges do not depend on an extra learned basis.

Twenty hand-built Python next-token tasks supply the behaviors, each a forced choice between two completions. One asks whether a string should close with `'` or `"`, differing only in the opening quote. Another asks whether a variable should be followed by `.add` or `+=`, differing only in whether it was initialized to `set()` or `""`. For each task, the model is pruned to the smallest circuit reaching a target loss, with pruned nodes mean-ablated to their average activation over the pretraining distribution. The headline metric is the geometric mean edge count across tasks.

## Sixteen-Fold Smaller Circuits

The sparse model curve sits about a factor of sixteen to the left of the dense model curve across the whole range, from circuit sizes near 128 for the sparse model where the dense model needs a few thousand.">
  <figcaption>Figure 1: Minimal circuit size needed to reach a given task loss, averaged across tasks, for a sparse and a dense model matched on pretraining loss. From Gao et al., <em>Weight-Sparse Transformers Have Interpretable Circuits</em>. {% cite "gao2025weightsparse" %}</figcaption>
</figure>

Compare a sparse model against a dense model with the same pretraining loss, and sweep the target task loss. At every accuracy level, the sparse model's minimal circuit is roughly 16 times smaller. Because the two models are matched on pretraining loss rather than on size, they are equally good at predicting text, and one of them explains itself in a sixteenth of the parts.

Mean-ablating every neuron except the few in the circuit preserves task loss, so the circuit is sufficient. Deleting just those few nodes severely harms task loss, so it is also necessary. Most published circuits establish sufficiency and leave necessity implicit, which permits a circuit that merely contains enough machinery to do the task while the model actually uses something else. Testing both is a stricter bar than most of the [circuit evaluation](/topics/circuit-evaluation/) literature meets.

## The Frontier

Weight sparsity is a dial, not a switch, and turning it up costs pretraining loss.

<figure>
  <img src="/topics/weight-sparse-training/images/capability_interpretability_frontier.png" alt="Scatter plot of pruned circuit size against pretraining loss, with five connected curves coloured by total parameter count. Within each curve, smaller weight L0 gives lower circuit size but higher loss. Larger total parameter counts shift entire curves down and to the left.">
  <figcaption>Figure 2: The capability-interpretability frontier. Within a curve, decreasing weight <em>L</em><sub>0</sub> trades capability for interpretability. Across curves, increasing total parameter count improves both. Down and to the left is better. From Gao et al., <em>Weight-Sparse Transformers Have Interpretable Circuits</em>. {% cite "gao2025weightsparse" %}</figcaption>
</figure>

Hold total parameter count fixed and make the weights sparser: pretraining loss gets worse, circuits get smaller. That is a trade, and it is the frontier we are on. Hold sparsity fixed and make the model wider: both improve at once, and the whole frontier moves outward.

Within the tested range, width recovers some capability lost to sparsity while keeping circuits smaller. A wider model can place the same number of nonzero weights among more possible connections and has fewer nonzeros per neuron; whether this continues to buy useful expressivity at much larger scales is empirical.{% sidenote "There is an information-theoretic gloss on this. The number of bits needed to specify *which* parameters are nonzero is roughly $\\mathcal{O}(L_0 \\log N)$ for $L_0$ nonzeros out of $N$ total, so growing $N$ at fixed $L_0$ enlarges the choice of sparsity patterns at logarithmic description cost." %} In these experiments, greater weight sparsity also produces sparser residual-stream activations without an explicit activation penalty.

The models here span 0.9M to 14.8M nonzero parameters, and the authors report that pushing past tens of millions while preserving interpretability remains unsolved. The demonstrated range is narrow.

<details class="pause-and-think">
<summary>Pause and think: what does the second axis actually measure?</summary>

The vertical axis in Figure 2 is "pruned circuit size (interpretability)". Take the parenthetical seriously for a moment and ask what could go wrong with it.

Circuit size is a proxy. It measures how few parts suffice, not whether those parts mean anything. A model could in principle have very compact circuits made of nodes that each do three unrelated things, and score well here while being no easier to understand. The authors say this directly: compact task-specific circuits do not fully capture intuitive notions of interpretability, and their qualitative investigations point at a stronger notion they have not managed to codify.

This is the same problem [SAE evaluation](/topics/sae-variants-and-evaluation/) has. Sparsity and reconstruction are measurable; interpretability is what we want; and the gap between them is where a metric can be gamed. The difference here is that the metric is defined on the model's own weights rather than on a learned dictionary, so at least there is no additional layer in which the gaming could hide.

## A Fully Enumerated Small Circuit

The quantitative results say circuits are small. Whether small means understandable is a separate question, and the only way to answer it is to read one. Three were read manually, across two models, at roughly a researcher-day each.

<figure>
  <img src="/topics/weight-sparse-training/images/string_closing_circuit.png" alt="Circuit diagram for closing a quoted string. Token embeddings for open-paren-double-quote and open-paren-single-quote feed two layer-zero MLP neurons acting as a quote detector and a quote type classifier. A layer ten attention head reads the detector as a key and the classifier as a value, producing the closing quote prediction. Activation examples for each node are shown at left.">
  <figcaption>Figure 3: The reported string-closing circuit: 12 nodes and 9 retained edges that preserve near-perfect performance on the task. Red and blue numbers are positive and negative weights. From Gao et al., <em>Weight-Sparse Transformers Have Interpretable Circuits</em>. {% cite "gao2025weightsparse" %}</figcaption>
</figure>

A string opens with either `'` or `"` and must close with the matching one. Under the paper's pruning procedure and evaluation set, 12 nodes and 9 edges preserve near-perfect performance. Figure 3 enumerates that retained circuit.

The layer-0 multilayer perceptron (MLP) combines the embeddings of the two opening tokens into two neurons: a quote detector, positive on both `("` and `('`, and a quote type classifier, positive on `("` and negative on `('`. Then a single attention head in layer 10 reads the detector as a key and the classifier as a value, with a constant positive query, so the final position attends to wherever a quote was opened and copies the sign of the classifier forward. Positive means double, negative means single.

These are model coordinates, and the numbers on the edges are learned weights rather than coefficients from a separate feature model. The functional labels remain human interpretations, but the circuit is small enough to inspect as a whole. Feature-level attribution graphs of much larger models are usually far harder to hold in mind at once.

The circuit's four main components have 41 edges connecting them to the rest of the network, of which this circuit uses 9. If components generally have so few total edges, it might eventually be possible to trace circuits by inspecting the weights alone, with no task-specific dataset at all, though this remains a hope rather than a finding. Bracket counting used 6 channels carrying 283 edges between them, plus another 1,217 from components elided from the write-up, and the authors judge that tracing it without task-specific data would likely be difficult.

## Understanding That Predicts a Failure

A circuit can reproduce the target behavior under its validation tests and still add little beyond a behavioral description. The bracket-counting account went further: it predicted an untested way to break the model.

The task is closing a flat list with `]` versus a nested list with `]]`. The embedding of `[` writes to a few residual channels that act as open-bracket detectors. A layer-2 attention head has a near-zero query and constant keys, so its softmax is uniform and the head simply *averages* the open-bracket detector over the whole context, writing the result to one residual channel whose magnitude encodes nesting depth. A layer-4 head then thresholds that magnitude by using it as a query against a strong attention sink: below the sink logit nothing happens, above it the head writes a "close with two brackets" signal.

Depth is stored as a *mean over the context*, and a mean shrinks as the context grows, so padding the context should dilute the signal. That prediction comes out of the circuit rather than out of testing, and both attacks it suggests work: unmatched open brackets in a preceding comment fool the model into `]]` on a flat list, and a sufficiently long nested list makes it predict `]` instead of `]]`, with the error tracking the magnitude of that one residual channel as $1/n_{\text{ctx}}$ would predict.

The dilution attack then transfers to dense models of comparable capability, so the mechanism was not an artifact of sparse training. Something similar is happening in the dense model, where it would have been much harder to find.

<details class="pause-and-think">
<summary>Pause and think: what would follow if the attack had not transferred?</summary>

Even without a familiar analogy, the human-readable circuit and its successful out-of-sample failure prediction would provide stronger evidence than a description fitted only to known behavior. The prediction is a useful test of understanding for this model and task.

The main transfer objection is that weight-sparse models are trained under a constraint unlike current general-purpose systems, with much higher compute at matched capability in these experiments. If their circuits are idiosyncratic to sparse training, understanding them may not transfer to dense models. That motivates the bridge experiments below.

Transfer is the evidence against that. The dilution attack was derived from a mechanism read off sparse weights and it breaks dense models too, which is weak but direct support for the assumption the whole program rests on: that transformers learn recurring circuit motifs, and that seeing them clearly in a sparse model tells you what to look for elsewhere. The authors also report that the tokens which are hard and easy for their sparse models are largely the same ones that are hard and easy for dense models.

</details>

## Bridges to Dense Models

The dilution attack transferred because a sparse and a dense model happened to compute the same way, which is an argument from resemblance. A tighter link would tie a sparse model to one specific dense model by construction.

<figure>
  <img src="/topics/weight-sparse-training/images/bridges.png" alt="Diagram of a dense model and a sparse model side by side, connected by four horizontal bridges, one before each sublayer. Loss terms are marked: a normalized MSE between bridged and actual activations, and KL divergences for hybrid forward passes running sparse-to-dense and dense-to-sparse.">
  <figcaption>Figure 4: Training a weight-sparse model jointly with bridges, so that mixed paths through sparse and dense sublayers still model the data well. From Gao et al., <em>Weight-Sparse Transformers Have Interpretable Circuits</em>. {% cite "gao2025weightsparse" %}</figcaption>
</figure>

Train a weight-sparse model alongside an existing dense model, with a **bridge** at each sublayer: an encoder mapping dense activations to sparse ones and a decoder mapping back.{% sidenote "Each bridge is effectively a sparse autoencoder whose latent space is another model's residual stream, with an AbsTopK encoder and a linear decoder. The unusual part is that the latents are not learned features but the activations of a second network that is being trained at the same time." %} Beyond the usual pretraining loss, the objective includes a normalized mean-squared-error (MSE) term training each encoder to predict sparse activations from dense ones and vice versa, plus Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence terms on *hybrid* forward passes that convert between the two activation types at a single location and require the result to still match the dense model.

A perturbation found in the interpretable model can then be pushed into the uninterpretable one. Pick a node from a pruned sparse circuit that both matters for the task and encodes something recognizable, perturb it in the sparse model, and map the perturbation through the bridge.

Steering the sparse model's quote type classifier from its double-quote value toward its single-quote value, then bridging, sharply raises the dense model's probability of emitting a single quote. In a second task, a channel that goes strongly negative on lines beginning `if`, `while`, or `except`, lines that must end in a colon, is steered from its `return True` value toward its `while True` value, and the dense model's probability of a colon rather than a newline goes up, though less sharply.

Both are preliminary and the authors label them so. But the perturbation applied to the dense model was chosen by reading a circuit in the sparse one, which is not something post-hoc analysis of the dense model alone would have supplied.

## Are Individual Weights Interpretable?

The circuits above were found behavior-first: pick a task, prune, read. That approach cannot say anything about a weight that participates in no task you thought to test, and a weight can serve different functions on different parts of the input distribution.

A follow-up asks the inverted question, on the same models: can we say what an individual weight does across the whole training distribution, without choosing a behavior first {% cite "marinllobet2026individual" %}? A weight counts as explained, in their sense, if we can say *when it matters*, on which inputs ablating it changes the model's predictions.

The pipeline is automated end to end. Ablate one weight, measure per-position KL divergence against the unablated model across a corpus, take the token contexts accounting for the top 90% of cumulative KL, and hand them to a large language model (LLM) with instructions to return a Python predicate `f(tokens, pos) -> bool` describing what they have in common. Then score the predicate causally. Ablate the weight everywhere, restore it only where the predicate fires, and measure how much of the ablation's effect on cross-entropy that recovers; separately, restore it only where the predicate does *not* fire, which guards against a predicate that succeeds by being vacuously broad. A coverage cap rules out predicates that fire nearly everywhere. Best of 100 candidates, and the weight counts as interpretable only if its best predicate clears the threshold on held-out text.

Pooled across sampled nonzero weights, the score is 15% for the weight-sparse code transformer, 9.6% for a sparse SimpleStories model, 1.5% for its dense counterpart, and 0.4% for Pythia-70m. Restricting to weights whose ablation actually does something, high cross-entropy impact, the sparse models reach 20 to 30% against 0 to 3% for the dense controls, and the paper's headline range is that 12 to 31% of weights admit a single short description that identifies what the weight is for.

The effect of a zero weight is exact: that connection contributes nothing. This gives most parameter locations in a highly sparse model a simple local account, although it does not explain the roles of the remaining nonzero weights or the behavior of the network as a whole. [Parameter decomposition](/topics/parameter-decomposition/) learns a basis in which weights may be easier to interpret; weight sparsity instead aims to make useful structure visible in the raw weight basis, avoiding uncertainty introduced by a separately learned decomposition.

## What This Costs

The reported unstructured weight-sparse networks require roughly 100 to 1,000 times the training and inference compute of dense networks at comparable capability. Sparse hardware and structured sparsity may change the engineering tradeoff, but this gap makes direct training at frontier scale impractical with current methods.

Circuits for the more complex tasks contain polysemantic nodes, with concepts still smeared across several of them, far less than in a dense model but not eliminated. Features are not all binarizable, so some carry information in their magnitude and explaining them means explaining the magnitude too, the bracket-depth channel is exactly this. Mean ablation is an imperfect faithfulness test, and full confidence would need something like [causal scrubbing](/topics/circuit-evaluation/) {% cite "chan2022causalscrubbing" %}. The pruning algorithm prunes nodes rather than edges and leaves residue that has to be cleared by hand. And weight sparsity may not be the only inductive bias needed; expert sparsity is floated as a complementary one.

Whether fine-grained explanation scales at all is a worry that goes beyond weight sparsity. Even optimistically, applying this method to complex behaviors in capable models would produce enormous circuits, because the explanations are maximally fine-grained, and making sense of those may be a job for automated interpretability. Pessimistically, capable models may perform complex tasks in ways that resist simple description at all. That would put a ceiling on ambitious mechanistic interpretability as a whole.

## Where This Could Go

Frontier-scale interpretable pretraining is off the table, so the proposals aim lower.

Scale the sparse models into a series of interpretable model organisms, up to something like GPT-3 capability, on the bet that transformers learn universal circuit motifs and that seeing them clearly at small scale tells you what to look for at large scale. Bridged sparse models would make this sharper, since comparing a sparse model's computations against a dense one's directly tests whether the same circuit motifs and failure mechanisms recur.

Or spend the compute on understanding less. Train a bridged sparse model on a narrow but important task distribution, deception, refusal, goal-seeking, rather than a whole pretraining corpus. That would not reverse-engineer a frontier model, but it could support a [safety case](/topics/safety-mechanisms-and-monitoring/) about a specific behavior, which is a more modest and more achievable target.

Or treat sparse circuits as primitives for automated interpretability. Dictionary learning gave the field a language in which computations are simpler to state, and sparse circuits give another; if automation is bottlenecked on primitives rather than on the automation itself, better primitives are what unblocks it.

## Looking Ahead

Both halves of this block push against an assumption the rest of the curriculum shares, that interpretability is something applied to a model after the fact. [Parameter decomposition](/topics/parameter-decomposition/) keeps the model and changes the coordinates; weight-sparse training changes the model. Neither has been demonstrated near frontier scale, and both are honest about it.

The [next block](/topics/refusal-direction/) turns to what interpretability is for. Many of the arguments there assume we can locate a behavior in a model we did not train, using methods whose faithfulness is contested, a tension the [limitations](/topics/mi-safety-limitations/) article takes up directly. The work here is one response to that tension: if the mechanisms we need are not legible in models as they are built, perhaps the models should be built differently.
