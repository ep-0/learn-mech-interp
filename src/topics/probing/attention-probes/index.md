glossary:
  - term: "Attention Probe"
    definition: "A probing classifier that uses a learned attention mechanism to aggregate per-token hidden states into a single representation for classification, replacing fixed pooling strategies like mean pooling or last-token selection."

exitCriteria:
  - task: "A sequence-level property must be classified from a $[\\text{seq\\_len}, d_{\\text{model}}]$ matrix of hidden states. Say what mean pooling and last-token selection each discard, and give a task where each fails."
    answer: |
      **Mean pooling** discards *localization*. Every position is weighted equally, so a signal concentrated in a few tokens is divided by the sequence length. It fails on jailbreak detection in a long prompt: the adversarial construction may occupy ten tokens out of eight hundred, and its contribution to the mean is diluted by a factor of eighty.

      **Last-token selection** discards *everything else*. It works when the model has aggregated the relevant information into the final position — which autoregressive models often do, since that is where the next-token prediction is formed — but it assumes the aggregation happened and that it preserved what you are looking for. It fails when the property is carried at the position where the evidence appeared and never propagated, or when the last token is punctuation or a template artifact whose representation is dominated by formatting.

      The deeper point is that this is a **researcher choice made before training**, it substantially affects probe accuracy, and it is usually reported as an implementation detail. A negative probing result — "this information is not present at layer 8" — may be a fact about the pooling rule rather than about the layer.
  - task: "Attention probes are more complex than linear probes. Explain why the added complexity does not obviously violate the probe-simplicity principle, and state the question for which it would."
    answer: |
      The attention operates **across token positions**, not across feature dimensions. It learns *where to look*; the classification is still a linear function of the attended representation, so the probe cannot synthesize features that were not already present in the hidden states. The worry behind probe simplicity — that a powerful probe computes the property rather than detecting it — concerns capacity to transform features, and this mechanism has none.

      It is not free of learned computation. Position selection is a real degree of freedom, and it can exploit incidental structure: a probe that learns to attend to whichever tokens happen to correlate with the label in the training set is fitting the dataset, not reading the model.

      **Which question it violates depends on what you are asking.** "Is this information accessible *somewhere* in the sequence?" — an attention probe is the right tool, and fixed pooling would understate accessibility. "Is this information accessible *at this token position*?" — the attention has answered a different question, and a per-token linear probe is required. The probe's design encodes the claim, so the claim has to be stated before the probe is chosen.
  - task: "Improving a baseline's token pooling from max-pooling to attention-based pooling dropped SAE probes' win rate against it from 19.6% to 8.7%. Interpret this in light of the aggregation problem."
    answer: |
      It shows that a large share of the SAE probes' apparent advantage was an **aggregation artifact**, not a representational one.

      SAE probes aggregate differently by construction: sparse features are typically max-pooled or summed over positions, and the sparsity means a feature firing strongly at one token survives aggregation intact. That is a *localization-preserving* pooling. Comparing it against a dense baseline that was mean- or max-pooled compared two things at once — the representation and the aggregation — and credited the difference entirely to the representation.

      Give the baseline attention-based pooling and it can also concentrate on the informative tokens. More than half the gap disappears.

      **The lesson generalizes:** when two methods differ in several respects, a performance gap attributes to whichever difference the authors were studying, unless the others are controlled. The correct comparison holds aggregation fixed and varies only the representation.

      It also recovers a positive finding: for sequence-level properties, *how you pool* can matter more than *what you pool*, which makes the aggregation choice worth reporting and sweeping rather than fixing by convention.

## The Aggregation Problem

[Probing classifiers](/topics/probing-classifiers/) test what information is encoded in a model's hidden states. The standard setup is clean: take a hidden state $\mathbf{h}_\ell$ at layer $\ell$, feed it to a linear classifier, and see if the classifier can predict some property. But this glosses over a practical problem that arises whenever the property belongs to the *sequence* rather than to a single token.

Consider classifying whether a prompt is a jailbreak attempt. The model produces a hidden state for every token in the sequence: a matrix of shape $[\text{seq\_len}, d_\text{model}]$. The probe needs a single vector to classify. How do we get from many vectors to one?

The two standard approaches are:

- **Mean pooling:** Average all token representations. Simple, but treats every token equally. A jailbreak signal concentrated in a few tokens gets diluted by hundreds of irrelevant ones.
- **Last-token selection:** Take only the final token's hidden state. This works when the model has aggregated relevant information into the last position (as in autoregressive models generating a response). But the last token is not always the most informative one for every task.

Both approaches discard information. Mean pooling washes out localized signals. Last-token selection ignores everything except one position. The choice between them is a researcher decision made before training, and it can substantially affect probe accuracy.{% sidenote "The aggregation problem is not unique to probing. It appears whenever a sequence model's per-token outputs must be reduced to a single representation, for instance in sequence classification fine-tuning. BERT's [CLS] token, mean pooling over token embeddings, and attention-based pooling are all responses to the same underlying problem." %}

## Letting the Probe Decide

Attention probes replace a fixed aggregation rule with a learned one. Instead of committing to mean pooling or the last token, we train the probe to weight positions for the classification task {% cite "shabalin2025attention" %}.

An attention probe works in three steps:

1. **Compute attention weights.** Project each hidden state to a scalar logit, then apply softmax across the sequence to get a probability distribution over token positions.
2. **Aggregate.** Use these attention weights to compute a weighted sum of the hidden states.
3. **Classify.** Apply a linear classifier to the aggregated representation.

More precisely, given hidden states $H \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times d}$ where $T$ is the sequence length and $d$ is the model dimension:

$$
\alpha = \text{softmax}(H W_q + \text{bias})
$$

$$
\mathbf{z} = \alpha^\top (H W_v)
$$

$$
\hat{y} = \mathbf{z} W_c + b_c
$$

where $W_q \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times 1}$ produces a single attention logit per token, $W_v \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d_v}$ projects hidden states to values, and $W_c$ is the final classification head.

> **Attention Probe:** A probing classifier that replaces fixed pooling with a learned attention mechanism over token positions. The probe learns which positions in the sequence carry information relevant to the classification task, then aggregates their representations via a weighted sum before classifying.

The attention weights $\alpha$ are the key innovation. They let the probe concentrate on whichever tokens carry the signal, rather than treating all positions equally or relying on a single one.

<summary>Pause and think: Probe complexity</summary>

Attention probes are more complex than linear probes. The [probing classifiers](/topics/probing-classifiers/) article discussed why probe simplicity matters: a powerful probe might learn the property itself rather than detecting it in the representations. Does adding attention to the probe cross this line?

The attention mechanism here operates *across token positions*, not across feature dimensions. It learns *where to look* in the sequence, but the classification itself still depends on a linear function of the attended representation. The probe cannot compute new features that were not already present in the hidden states. It can, however, select which tokens to read from, which is a form of learned computation. Whether this is acceptable depends on the probing question: if you are asking "is this information accessible somewhere in the sequence?", an attention probe is appropriate. If you are asking "is this information accessible at a specific token position?", a per-token linear probe is the right tool.

## Multi-Head Attention and Positional Bias

The single-head formulation above can be extended in two ways {% cite "shabalin2025attention" %}:

**Multiple heads.** Just as transformer attention uses multiple heads to attend to different positions simultaneously, a multi-head attention probe can learn several independent attention patterns. Each head produces its own weighted sum, and the results are concatenated before classification:

$$
\mathbf{z} = \text{concat}(\mathbf{z}_1, \mathbf{z}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{z}_H)
$$

This lets the probe attend to multiple relevant positions at once. An 8-head probe can simultaneously attend to, say, a subject token, a verb, and a negation word if all three matter for the classification.

**Positional bias.** Inspired by ALiBi (Attention with Linear Biases), a learnable position-dependent term can be added to the attention logits:

$$
\alpha = \text{softmax}(H W_q + w_\text{pos} \cdot [0, 1, 2, \ldots, T{-}1])
$$

The scalar $w_\text{pos}$ is learned. A negative value biases the probe toward later tokens (similar to last-token selection). A positive value biases toward earlier tokens. The optimizer finds whatever positional preference helps classification.

## What the Experiments Show

Shabalin and Belrose (2025) evaluated attention probes against mean-pooling and last-token baselines across two families of benchmarks {% cite "shabalin2025attention" %}:

On **MOSAIC datasets** (sequence classification tasks like jailbreak detection, sentiment analysis, and intent classification), 8-head attention probes generally outperformed mean probes trained with the AdamW optimizer. The gains were modest but consistent.

On **Neurons in a Haystack datasets** (probing tasks from Gurnee et al.), results were noisier. Last-token probes often outperformed mean probes on these tasks, which is the opposite of the MOSAIC pattern. Attention probes did not show a clear advantage.

An important finding: switching the optimizer from AdamW to L-BFGS substantially improved mean and last-token probe performance, narrowing the gap with attention probes. Some of the advantage attributed to the attention architecture may have been compensating for suboptimal optimization of simpler baselines.{% sidenote "The optimizer finding is a useful cautionary note. In probing research, it is easy to attribute performance differences to the probe architecture when they actually stem from training details like optimizer choice, learning rate, or regularization strength. The probe is simple enough that these details matter." %}

Attention probes are **not uniformly better** than simpler alternatives. Their advantage is dataset-dependent: strongest when useful signal is localized at variable positions, and weakest when it is diffuse or already concentrated at the final token.

## Reading the Probe's Attention

The learned attention weights show which token positions receive large coefficients in the probe's pooled representation. They can therefore suggest where the probe finds useful evidence.

Shabalin and Belrose (2025) observed this on the Bias in Bios dataset: weights concentrated on gender-associated terms while the probe classified professions from biographies {% cite "shabalin2025attention" %}.

These weights are not a complete feature attribution. A position with high weight may carry a small value vector, and several low-weight positions may contribute coherently. The same caution that applies to a transformer's [attention patterns](/topics/reading-attention-patterns/) applies here: weights describe routing inside the probe, not the full effect of each token on its decision.

McKenzie et al. (2025) used a similar aggregation strategy for detecting high-stakes interactions, reporting an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) above 0.95 at far lower inference cost than a separate LLM monitor {% cite "mckenzie2025probes" %}. Inspecting high-weight positions helped researchers form hypotheses about which parts of a conversation influenced the detector.

<details class="pause-and-think">
<summary>Pause and think: When would attention probes help most?</summary>

Consider two probing tasks: (1) classifying whether a prompt contains a SQL injection attempt, and (2) classifying the overall sentiment of a long product review. For which task would you expect attention probes to outperform mean pooling? Why?

SQL injection detection is a case where the relevant signal is highly localized: a few tokens like `'; DROP TABLE` carry all the information. Mean pooling would dilute this signal across hundreds of benign tokens. An attention probe can learn to focus on the suspicious tokens. Sentiment, by contrast, is often distributed across the entire review: many words contribute incrementally to the overall sentiment. Mean pooling captures this diffuse signal reasonably well, and attention probes may offer little advantage. The general principle: attention probes help most when the signal is sparse and localized in the sequence.

## Where Attention Probes Fit

Attention probes occupy a specific niche in the probing toolkit. They add a small amount of learned computation (position-wise aggregation) to the standard linear probe, without adding nonlinear feature computation over the representation dimensions.

Probe families differ in how much work they learn to do before the final linear classification:

| Probe type | Aggregation | Classification | Use case |
|-----------|------------|---------------|----------|
| Linear (per-token) | None (single position) | Linear | Per-token properties |
| Mean probe | Mean pool | Linear | Sequence properties, diffuse signal |
| Last-token probe | Last position | Linear | Sequence properties, autoregressive models |
| Attention probe | Learned weighting | Linear | Sequence properties, localized signal |

The [probe complexity tradeoff](/topics/probing-classifiers/) still applies: each step up in complexity makes success harder to interpret. A mean probe that succeeds tells us the information is linearly accessible on average across positions. An attention probe that succeeds tells us the information is linearly accessible *somewhere* in the sequence, but the probe is doing work to find where. Whether that "finding" counts as the probe computing the answer or merely locating it depends on the specific task.

## Looking Forward

Attention probes address a real practical limitation of standard probing: the lossy aggregation step that discards positional information. They do not change the fundamental [correlation-vs-causation limitation](/topics/probing-classifiers/) of all probing methods. An attention probe with high accuracy still tells us what information is *accessible*, not what the model *uses*. For that, we still need the causal intervention methods covered in [activation patching](/topics/activation-patching/) and beyond.

The aggregation problem becomes even more pressing when probes move from research to deployment. In [production safety systems](/topics/probes-in-production/), probes must handle sequences ranging from a few tokens to hundreds of thousands, under adversarial pressure, with extremely low false positive rates. The architectural choices covered here (learned attention, multi-head aggregation) are starting points for the more specialized aggregation methods that production requires.
