## From Single Pairs to Robust Directions

If concepts are linear directions in activation space, we can find them by computing the difference between activations for contrasting inputs. But a single contrast pair may capture noise alongside the target concept. If "Love" and "Hate" differ in ways beyond just sentiment, perhaps one is longer, mentions specific topics, or triggers different positional patterns, the resulting vector encodes those differences too.{% sidenote "This is the same problem that arises with any contrastive method built from few samples. The steering vector captures the full difference between two activations, not just the semantically meaningful part. Averaging over many pairs mitigates this by canceling out pair-specific noise." %}

This motivates a more robust approach: averaging over many contrast pairs to isolate the shared direction.

## The CAA Method

Panickssery et al. (2024) proposed **Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA)**: instead of one contrast pair, average the activation differences over *many* pairs {% cite "panickssery2024caa" %}:

$$
\mathbf{v} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( \mathbf{h}_i^{(+)} - \mathbf{h}_i^{(-)} \right)
$$

where $\mathbf{h}_i^{(+)}$ and $\mathbf{h}_i^{(-)}$ are the activations for the $i$-th positive and negative prompt.

Averaging cancels out noise specific to individual pairs. What remains is the **shared direction** corresponding to the target concept. If every positive prompt involves more sycophancy and every negative prompt involves less, the average difference vector points in the "sycophancy direction," with pair-specific artifacts washed out.

> **Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA):** A method for computing concept directions by averaging activation differences across many contrast pairs. The averaging process isolates the shared direction corresponding to the target concept while canceling pair-specific noise.

## The Procedure

1. **Construct many contrasting prompt pairs.** Each pair should differ primarily in the concept you want to probe. For sycophancy: pairs where one response agrees with the user and one disagrees. For honesty: pairs where one response is truthful and one is deceptive.

2. **Run all prompts through the model.** Collect residual stream activations at a chosen layer $\ell$ for both positive and negative prompts.

3. **Compute the mean difference:**

$$
\mathbf{v} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( \mathbf{h}_i^{(+)} - \mathbf{h}_i^{(-)} \right)
$$

4. **Treat the mean difference as a candidate concept direction.** It points from the negative class mean toward the positive class mean for this dataset.

## Layer-Specific Effects

Not all layers are equally informative. Panickssery et al. found that **layers 15-17** in Llama 2 (7B and 13B) show the most significant concept separation. The pattern makes intuitive sense:

- **Early layers** are too close to token space. Representations are still input-specific, encoding surface-level features like token identity and position.
- **Late layers** are too committed to output. The model has already decided what to generate.
- **Middle layers** encode concepts in their most abstract form. This is where semantic directions are cleanest and most detectable.

## Applications: Sycophancy Detection

CAA was applied to probe **sycophancy**, the tendency to agree with the user regardless of accuracy:

The computed sycophancy direction successfully distinguishes:
- Responses that agree with the user (even when wrong)
- Responses that provide truthful answers (even when contradicting the user)

On these prompts and layers, a linear direction carries enough information to distinguish sycophantic from non-sycophantic responses. That does not show that sycophancy has only one representation or that the model uses this direction causally.

## Persona Vectors: Automating the Contrast Set

CAA requires a researcher to turn a concept into matched examples. Chen et al. (2025) automate much of that construction for behavioral traits such as sycophancy and hallucination {% cite "chen2025persona" %}. They call the resulting CAA-style direction a **persona vector**.

Starting from a trait name and a natural-language description, an LLM generates two sets of system prompts: one instructs the model to display the trait, and the other instructs it to display the opposite. It also generates evaluation questions on which the trait could become visible. The target model produces multiple responses under both conditions, and an LLM judge filters out responses that do not actually express the requested behavior.

For layer $\ell$, let $R_i^{(+)}$ and $R_i^{(-)}$ be the response-token positions retained for the two conditions. First average within each response, then average across responses and subtract:

$$
\mathbf{v}_{\ell}^{\text{persona}}
=
\mathbb{E}_i\!\left[\frac{1}{|R_i^{(+)}|}\sum_{t\in R_i^{(+)}}\mathbf{h}_{\ell,t}^{(+)}\right]
-
\mathbb{E}_i\!\left[\frac{1}{|R_i^{(-)}|}\sum_{t\in R_i^{(-)}}\mathbf{h}_{\ell,t}^{(-)}\right]
$$

This is the same mean-difference geometry as CAA. The main changes are how the contrast set is generated, that activations are pooled across response tokens, and that the procedure produces a candidate vector at every layer. Chen et al. choose a layer by testing which candidate direction most reliably steers held-out behavior.

<figure>
  <img src="images/persona-vector-pipeline.png" alt="Pipeline for constructing a persona vector. A language model generates responses to the same questions under system prompts that request an undesirable trait or its opposite. Activations are extracted and averaged within each condition, then the two condition means are subtracted.">
  <figcaption>A persona vector is an automated, trait-conditioned instance of contrastive activation averaging. The prompts, responses, and judge introduce their own assumptions, so automation does not remove the need for validation. From Chen et al., <em>Persona Vectors: Monitoring and Controlling Character Traits in Language Models</em>. {%- cite "chen2025persona" -%}</figcaption>
</figure>

The name can sound more ontologically ambitious than the method warrants. A persona vector is a direction recovered from a particular contrast construction. It need not be the unique direction for that trait, and it can include correlated properties of the prompts, responses, or judge. In the paper's main experiments, the method was tested on evil behavior, sycophancy, and hallucination in Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. That is evidence that the recipe transfers across these traits and two model families, not that every aspect of a model's persona is one-dimensional.

## Reading a Trait Before the Response

The same vector can act as a probe. For a new prompt $x$, take the residual activation at the final prompt token and project it onto the normalized persona vector:

$$
s_{\ell}(x)=\mathbf{h}_{\ell,t_{\mathrm{last}}}(x)\cdot
\frac{\mathbf{v}_{\ell}^{\text{persona}}}{\|\mathbf{v}_{\ell}^{\text{persona}}\|}
$$

If the score separates prompts that lead to high-trait and low-trait responses, the prompt representation contains a linearly accessible warning signal before generation begins. Chen et al. found strong separation when prompts came from explicitly different trait-inducing conditions. Separation was more modest within a single prompt type, where the surface cues were better controlled. The second result is the harder and more relevant test: a monitor should predict behavioral variation rather than merely recognize the instruction used to create the contrast.

Projection, steering, and held-out evaluation answer different questions. Projection shows that the direction is readable, steering tests whether changing the direction affects behavior, and held-out prompts test whether either result transfers beyond the construction set. A convincing persona-vector study needs all three.

<summary>Pause and think: Designing contrast pairs</summary>

Suppose you want to find a direction corresponding to "formal vs. informal" writing style. How would you design the contrast pairs for CAA? What considerations would guide your choice of prompts?

For contrast pairs, you would want prompts that elicit the same content but differ in formality. Ask the same question with instructions to "respond formally" versus "respond casually." The key challenge is ensuring your pairs differ primarily in formality, not in content, length, or topic. You would want diverse topics and question types to ensure the averaged direction captures formality itself, not artifacts of specific domains.

</details>

## Additivity and Robustness

The reported CAA directions transfer across prompt sets and combine with other interventions:

- CAA + fine-tuning: the effects combine without interfering.
- CAA + few-shot prompting: prompting effects and probing effects are additive.
- Directions computed from different prompt sets for the same concept are highly correlated.

Transfer across prompt sets is evidence against pair-specific noise, but it does not prove that the direction is unique or causally used.{% sidenote "Different contrast sets can share unintended features such as tone, length, or formatting. A transferred direction may encode one of those common cues alongside the intended concept, so robustness tests should vary the construction of the pairs as well as their topics." %}

## Connection to Steering

Once you have computed a concept direction via CAA, that same direction can be used for [steering](/topics/addition-steering/). The direction that a linear classifier uses to *detect* a concept is the same direction you can *add* to induce that concept. CAA provides the **probing** half of representation engineering; [addition steering](/topics/addition-steering/) provides the **control** half.

<details class="pause-and-think">
<summary>Pause and think: How many pairs are enough?</summary>

CAA averages over many contrast pairs. But how many is "many"? What factors would influence the number of pairs needed for a reliable direction?

The number depends on how much pair-specific noise exists relative to the true concept signal. Concepts with clear, unambiguous manifestations (like language: English vs. French) might need fewer pairs. Subtle behavioral concepts (like sycophancy) where the manifestation varies by context might need more pairs to average out the variation. Empirically, studies have used anywhere from 50 to several hundred pairs. The diagnostic is consistency: if adding more pairs doesn't change the direction significantly, you likely have enough.

</details>

## Looking Forward

CAA provides a principled method for finding concept directions in activation space. The same methodology applies whether you're probing sentiment, sycophancy, honesty, or safety-relevant properties like [refusal](/topics/refusal-direction/). Persona vectors show how the contrast-set construction can be automated for named traits, while preserving the same validation burden as any other probe. These directions support both [inference-time control](/topics/addition-steering/) and, later, [interventions on the training process](/topics/interpretability-guided-training/).
