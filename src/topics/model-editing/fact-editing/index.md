  - task: "ROME's rank-one update changes $W_{\\text{out}}$ so the MLP retrieves a new value for one subject key. State the insertion-versus-editing problem and why edit success cannot settle it."
    answer: |
      **The problem:** ROME assumes the update *replaces* the stored association — Paris out, London in. The alternative is that it *inserts* an override, leaving the original association intact underneath while changing what the model outputs.

      **Why edit success cannot settle it:** both accounts predict identical behavior on the tests ROME runs. Prompt the model about the Eiffel Tower and it says London under either story — because either the memory was overwritten, or the old value is still there and a stronger new write dominates downstream. Success on paraphrases shows the override generalizes across phrasings, which an insertion produces just as readily as a replacement. Success on unrelated facts shows the update is narrow, which both predict.

      The two accounts differ only in what remains *recoverable inside the model*, and behavioral evaluation on edited prompts never looks there.

      **What would distinguish them:** probe for the original association after the edit — can a linear probe still decode Paris from the subject representation? Does the fact resurface under a different elicitation route, a different language, or a multi-hop question that must pass through the location rather than state it? A persistent decodable Paris is insertion, and it means the edit is a surface patch over intact knowledge.
  - task: "ROME's Stage 1 localizes facts with causal tracing using Gaussian-noise corruption. Explain why this specific choice complicates the interpretability claim that motivated the method."
    answer: |
      Gaussian noise at $\mathcal{N}(0, 3\sigma)$ on the subject embeddings puts the model far outside its training distribution, and downstream components then operate in abnormal regimes. Under that corruption, restoring an upstream activation cannot repair the damage already done to intermediate components, so the restoration sites that appear most effective are biased toward those closest to the readout.

      Comparing corruption methods directly, symmetric token replacement — which keeps both prompts as natural sentences — produces no comparable mid-layer MLP peak on the same model and task, and the Gaussian-noise peak was two to five times larger.

      **Why this complicates the claim:** the mid-layer MLP localization is what motivated editing mid-layer MLPs specifically, and it may be partly an artifact of the corruption method rather than a fact about where the model stores facts. The editing technique still works — that is a behavioral result and does not depend on the localization being right — but the mechanistic story that made ROME interesting is weakened.

      This is the pattern the article names: a practical intervention outrunning its interpretation. Editing at layer $\ell$ succeeding does not establish that the fact lived at layer $\ell$, any more than a successful patch establishes a mechanism.
  - task: "\"Editing a fact by modifying specific weights would constitute strong evidence that the fact is localized in those weights.\" Assess this claim."
    answer: |
      It is the argument that makes model editing interesting to interpretability rather than only to engineering, and it does not hold as stated.

      **Why it seems compelling:** if you can change one fact by touching one small set of weights, and nothing else moves, the natural inference is that those weights were where the fact was.

      **Why it fails:** a successful edit shows the location is a **sufficient point of intervention**, not the site of storage. Two counter-accounts survive the evidence intact. Insertion: the update overrides a fact stored elsewhere, and the original remains recoverable. And a *bottleneck* account: the edited site may be a place every route to the answer must pass through — a shared pathway — so intervening there is effective regardless of where the association is held. A valve is not a reservoir.

      The general form is one this curriculum keeps returning to: an intervention that changes behavior establishes causal participation under that intervention, and localization is a stronger claim requiring evidence that the information is *absent elsewhere*. Editing success and localization evidence came apart in exactly this way, which is why ROME reads better as a case study than as a localization result.

## Editing Facts in Weights

Language models store factual associations in their weights. When a model completes "The Eiffel Tower is located in ___" with "Paris," some part of its parameters supports that association. A targeted editor tries to replace "Paris" with "London" for this subject without retraining the model or disturbing unrelated knowledge.

This question matters for both practical and scientific reasons. Practically, models acquire outdated or incorrect information during training, and targeted editing would be cheaper than retraining. Scientifically, the ability to edit a fact by modifying specific weights would constitute strong evidence that the fact is *localized* in those weights, a causal claim about where knowledge lives in the network.

Meng et al. {% cite "meng2022rome" %} developed **ROME** (Rank-One Model Editing), an influential technique for localized fact editing. It combines causal localization with a targeted weight update. Later work found that editing success and localization evidence can come apart, making ROME a useful case study in how a practical intervention can outrun its mechanistic interpretation.

## The ROME Approach

ROME operates in two stages: first, identify *where* a fact is stored; second, modify the weights at that location.

**Stage 1: Causal tracing.** To find where a fact is stored, Meng et al. used a variant of [activation patching](/topics/activation-patching/). They corrupted the subject token embeddings with Gaussian noise (so the model could no longer retrieve the fact), then restored activations at individual layers and positions to see which restoration recovered the correct answer. The results pointed to specific MLP layers in the middle of the network as the primary storage sites for factual associations.{% sidenote "The causal tracing results showed a distinctive pattern: restoring MLP activations at early-to-mid layers at the last subject token position recovered the fact, while restoring attention activations or activations at other positions did not. This was interpreted as evidence for a localized key-value storage mechanism in MLPs." %}

Theoretical work on knowledge storage provides some support for this localization. Allen-Zhu and Li {% cite "allenzhu2023physics" %} showed that knowledge extraction from specific layers has a principled basis: models trained with sufficient data augmentation store factual associations in ways that are extractable from targeted MLP layers, providing partial theoretical justification for why causal tracing finds localized signals.

**Stage 2: Rank-one editing.** Having identified the target layer, ROME modifies the MLP's weight matrix with a rank-one update. The MLP can be viewed as a key-value memory: the first projection ($W_{\text{in}}$) maps the input to a key, and the second projection ($W_{\text{out}}$) maps the key to a value that is added to the residual stream. A rank-one update to $W_{\text{out}}$ changes the value associated with one specific key (the subject's representation) while leaving all other key-value pairs approximately unchanged:

$$
W_{\text{out}}' = W_{\text{out}} + \frac{k^T (v^* - v_0)}{k \, k^T}
$$

where $k$ is the key vector for the target subject, $v_0$ is the original value, and $v^*$ is the new value that encodes the desired fact. This changes what the MLP outputs when it recognizes the subject, effectively overwriting one entry in the key-value store.

> **ROME (Rank-One Model Editing):** Edit a specific factual association by computing a rank-one update to a targeted MLP layer's output projection. The update modifies the value vector associated with one subject's key representation, changing the fact that the MLP retrieves for that subject while attempting to leave other associations intact.

ROME could change “The Eiffel Tower is in Paris” to “The Eiffel Tower is in London” and produce “London” across several related phrasings while leaving sampled unrelated facts mostly unchanged. Those tests establish useful behavioral generalization, but not yet the internal replacement of the old association.

## The Insertion-Versus-Editing Flaw

The core assumption of ROME is that the rank-one update *edits* the stored fact, replacing "Paris" with "London." But there is a subtler possibility: the update *inserts* a new association without erasing the old one.

If the old association remains recoverable and the new one is layered on top, success on edited prompts need not mean that a localized memory was replaced. The rank-one update may act as an override that changes the downstream answer while related representations elsewhere remain intact.

Hase et al. {% cite "hase2024localization" %} tested the connection between localization and editability. Their findings weaken the inference from “this layer is easy to edit” to “this is where the fact is stored”:

**Localization and editing can disagree.** Causal-tracing scores do not reliably predict where the tested edits work best. This shows that a site with a large patching effect and a site where an update is effective answer different intervention questions; neither result alone identifies a unique storage location.

**Edits do not erase the original fact.** After editing "Eiffel Tower → London," probing the model's intermediate representations reveals that "Paris" is still encoded in early and middle layers. The rank-one update at the target layer overrides the output, but the original knowledge persists upstream. The edit is a patch, not a correction.

**Pathological side effects emerge.** Because the edit is an insertion rather than a replacement, the model's internal state becomes inconsistent. Layers before the edit site still encode "Paris." Layers after the edit site see "London." This inconsistency produces failures on questions that require integrating the fact with other knowledge: "What country is the Eiffel Tower in?" might produce "France" (from the unedited upstream representation) instead of "England" (which would be consistent with the edited "London").{% sidenote "The inconsistency between edited and unedited layers is a specific instance of a broader problem: localized edits assume facts are stored in one place, but transformer representations are distributed. A fact's influence flows through many layers via the residual stream, and editing one layer does not update the representations that other layers have already contributed." %}

<details class="pause-and-think">
<summary>Pause and think: Why rank-one updates produce overrides, not edits</summary>

Consider the mechanics of the rank-one update $W' = W + \Delta W$, where $\Delta W$ is a rank-one matrix. The original weight matrix $W$ still contributes to the output for all inputs. The update $\Delta W$ adds a correction that is large for the target key and small for other keys. Why does this architecture naturally produce an override rather than an edit? What would a genuine edit require?

A rank-one update can, in principle, contain both negative and positive components: it could subtract the old output and add a new one for the target key. The problem is not that matrix addition is mathematically incapable of replacement. It is that ROME optimizes a local output constraint without identifying and updating every distributed representation or retrieval path that supports the old fact. A successful answer override therefore does not tell us whether the original association was removed elsewhere in the network.

## Broader Implications

The ROME story illustrates several principles that extend beyond fact editing.

**Causal localization does not imply causal sufficiency for editing.** Finding that a component is causally important for retrieving a fact (via activation patching) does not mean that modifying that component is sufficient to change the fact. The fact may be redundantly encoded, with multiple components contributing. Editing one location leaves the others intact, producing inconsistency rather than clean modification.

**Beware the illusion of success.** ROME appeared to work well when evaluated on surface-level metrics (does the model say "London" instead of "Paris"?). The failures emerged only when testing for deeper consistency (does the model's broader knowledge update coherently?). This is a general risk in MI: a technique can appear successful when evaluated narrowly but fail when probed more carefully.

**The distributed nature of knowledge.** Factual knowledge in transformers is not stored in a single MLP layer like an entry in a database. It is distributed across layers, encoded redundantly, and accessed through multiple pathways. The residual stream carries information forward from many sources, and later layers integrate contributions from earlier ones. Any technique that assumes strict localization of knowledge will encounter the same fundamental problem.

MEMIT {% cite "meng2023memit" %} extended ROME to edit multiple facts by distributing updates across several layers. This improves edit capacity, but the same evidential gap remains: output-level success does not show that old associations and all of their consequences have been coherently replaced throughout the model.

## Lessons for Interpretability Rigor

The fact editing literature teaches a meta-lesson about how to evaluate interpretability claims.

**Test for the mechanism, not just the output.** If we claim a technique edits knowledge, we should verify that the old knowledge is actually gone, not just that the new answer appears. Output-level evaluation alone can be misleading.

**Test for consistency, not just the target behavior.** An edit that changes the answer to one question but produces inconsistent answers to related questions has not truly modified the model's knowledge. Evaluation should probe for coherence across the neighborhood of the modified fact.

**Distinguish correlation from mechanism.** Causal tracing shows where factual information is *processed*, but this does not mean that location is the sole *source* of the information or that modifying it will cleanly change the fact. The processing site and the storage site may differ, and storage may be distributed.

These principles apply broadly. For a claim such as “this component stores X” or “this circuit computes Z,” ask what observation would distinguish the hypothesis from a plausible alternative, then run that test.

## Looking Ahead

The limitations of localized fact editing motivate methods whose guarantees state exactly what has been removed. [LEACE](/topics/concept-erasure/) makes a narrower promise: under its population assumptions, a transformed representation is linearly guarded for a chosen label with minimum expected distortion. It does not rewrite a fact or eliminate nonlinear information, but its explicit scope illustrates what ROME's behavioral edit metrics leave unresolved.
