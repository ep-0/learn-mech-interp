# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the mechanistic interpretability curriculum. This guide covers the project structure, how to run the site locally, and how to add or modify articles.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm

### Local development

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd learn-mech-interp
npm install
npm start        # serve locally with hot reload
npm run build    # one-off production build
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:8080/learn-mech-interp/`.

## Project structure

```

Key points:
- **`learningPath.js` and `glossary.js` are computed from the filesystem.** You never edit them directly. The sidebar, topics page, prev/next navigation, and glossary all update automatically when you add or modify articles.
- **`references.json` and `pageContexts.json` are the data files you edit by hand** -- the first to add citations, the second to sharpen the context that ships with exported reading notes. Everything else under `_data/` is computed.
- **URLs are flat.** An article at `src/topics/probing/probing-classifiers/index.md` is served at `/topics/probing-classifiers/`, not `/topics/probing/probing-classifiers/`.

## Adding a new article

### 1. Choose the right block

First identify the reusable technique or concept being taught. A paper is a source, not an organizing unit: split its contributions among the existing concept articles that own them, and create a new article only when a concept deserves to be learned independently.

Articles are grouped into thematic blocks. Each block is a directory under `src/topics/` with a `_block.json` file. Pick the block that fits your article's topic.

If no existing block fits, see [Adding a new block](#adding-a-new-block) below.

### 2. Create the article directory

```bash
mkdir src/topics/<block-slug>/<article-slug>
```

The article slug becomes part of the URL (`/topics/<article-slug>/`), so choose something short, lowercase, and hyphenated.

### 3. Write `index.md`

Create `src/topics/<block-slug>/<article-slug>/index.md` with this frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Article Title"
description: "A one-sentence summary for the article header and metadata."
order: N
prerequisites:
  - title: "Prerequisite Article Title"
    url: "/topics/prerequisite-slug/"
glossary:
  - term: "Key Term"
    definition: "Concise definition of the term."
---

Article content here...
```

**Required fields:**
- `title` -- the article's display title
- `description` -- shown below the title on the article page
- `order` -- integer position within the block (1-indexed, contiguous, no gaps)

**Optional fields:**
- `prerequisites` -- list of articles the reader should complete first
- `glossary` -- terms this article defines (appear on the glossary page)

### 4. Set the correct order

The `order` field determines where the article appears within its block. Orders must be contiguous starting from 1. If you are adding an article to a block that already has 3 articles (orders 1, 2, 3), your new article should be order 4 (appending) or you need to renumber existing articles to insert it elsewhere.

### 5. Add citations

If your article cites papers, add entries to `src/_data/references.json`:

```json
"bibtex_key": {
  "title": "Paper Title",
  "authors": "Last, F., Last, F., et al.",
  "year": 2024,
  "venue": "Conference or Publisher",
  "url": "https://..."
}
```

Then reference them inline with `{% cite "bibtex_key" %}`.

### 6. Add images (optional)

Place images in `src/topics/<block-slug>/<article-slug>/images/`. Reference them with absolute paths:

```markdown
![Alt text](/topics/<article-slug>/images/filename.png)
```

The build remaps nested image directories to flat output paths, so the URL does not include the block slug.

### 7. Read the article guidelines

**Before writing content, read `ARTICLE_GUIDELINES.md`.** It covers tone, structure, formatting, and the pedagogical approach. The short version:

- The textbook is organized by **techniques, concepts, or method families**, never by individual papers. Papers provide evidence inside those articles.
- Start with motivation, then concrete examples, then abstractions
- Use `{% sidenote "..." %}` for tangents and `{% marginnote "..." %}` for unnumbered margin notes
- Use `<details class="pause-and-think">` for engagement prompts (aim for 1--3 per article)
- Use blockquote format for key definitions: `> **Term:** Definition here.`
- Cite at the point of the claim with `{% cite "key" %}`
- Keep articles to roughly 15--25 minutes reading time

### 8. Verify

Run `npm run build`. The build-time validator checks:

- Required frontmatter fields (`title`, `description`, `order`)
- Contiguous ordering within blocks (no gaps or duplicates)
- All `{% cite "key" %}` keys exist in `references.json`
- All prerequisite URLs point to existing articles
- No duplicate glossary terms across articles
- Every `/topics/<slug>/` key in `pageContexts.json` matches a live article

If the build fails, the error message will tell you exactly what to fix.

## Modifying an existing article

- **Content edits** (fixing errors, improving explanations, adding sections): edit `index.md` directly. Read `ARTICLE_GUIDELINES.md` if you are making substantive changes.
- **Reordering**: change the `order` field in the affected articles. Keep orders contiguous within the block.
- **Moving to a different block**: `git mv` the article directory, then update the `order` fields in both the source and destination blocks so they remain contiguous.
- **Adding glossary terms**: add entries to the `glossary:` list in the article's frontmatter. Each term must be unique across all articles.
- **Adding citations**: add the reference to `src/_data/references.json`, then use `{% cite "key" %}` in the article.

## Adding a new block

1. Create `src/topics/<block-slug>/_block.json`:

```json
{
  "title": "Block Display Title",
  "order": N
}
```

2. Block `order` must be contiguous with existing blocks. If there are currently 12 blocks (orders 1--12), a new block should be order 13 (appending) or you need to renumber existing blocks to insert it.

3. Add at least one article inside the block directory.

## Reading notes

Readers can take notes as they read: a drawer on every page (the notes button in the header, or `Alt+N`)
and a hub at `/notes/` that lists every note. Both read and write one `localStorage` record, so a note
edited in either place is the same note -- notes written on the hub with **Attach to: no page** belong to
no article and stay off the drawers.

The point of the feature is the export. Each note is wrapped in the context of the page it was taken on --
what the article covers, where it sits in the curriculum, its sections, prerequisites, glossary terms and
cited work -- so the result can be pasted into a conversation and discussed without re-reading the textbook.

That context is assembled at build time, never in the browser:

```
src/_data/pageContexts.json   hand-written overrides, keyed by page URL
        +
article frontmatter, headings, prerequisites, glossary, citations
        |
src/_data/noteContexts.js     merges the two (your text wins field by field)
        |
/notes-context.json           fetched once, on the first export
```

**Adding an article needs no work here.** Its context is derived from what the article already declares,
so it is covered as soon as it exists.

**To sharpen a page's context by hand**, add an entry to `src/_data/pageContexts.json` keyed by the page
URL, with the trailing slash:

```json
"/topics/induction-heads/": {
  "summary": "Two heads composing into a pattern-copying circuit, and how far the ICL claim actually goes.",
  "keyIdeas": ["The prefix-matching and copying steps are separable."],
  "openQuestions": ["How much of in-context learning do induction heads really account for?"],
  "related": ["/topics/ioi-circuit/"],
  "guidance": "Be skeptical of the phase-change-implies-causation reading."
}
```

Every field is optional and merges on top of the derived context, so writing `summary` alone leaves the
sections, prerequisites and citations in place. Keys starting with `_` are documentation and are ignored;
the file's own `_about` entry describes each field. Non-article pages (`/`, `/glossary/`, `/about/`, ...)
have no frontmatter to derive from, so their context comes entirely from this file.

The build fails if a `/topics/<slug>/` key here does not match a live article, which is what keeps the file
honest when an article is renamed or retired.

## Build-time validation

Every build (including `npm start` in dev mode) runs validation. To temporarily skip it while working on incomplete articles:

```bash
SKIP_VALIDATION=1 npm start
```

Do not merge to `main` with validation disabled. CI will catch it.

## Shortcode reference

| Shortcode | Usage | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `{% cite "key" %}` | Inline | Numbered citation with hover tooltip |
| `{% sidenote "text" %}` | Inline | Numbered Tufte-style sidenote |
| `{% marginnote "text" %}` | Inline | Unnumbered margin note |

## Deployment

The site deploys automatically to GitHub Pages on push to `main`. The CI pipeline runs `npm ci`, builds with Eleventy, and uploads the `_site` directory. Pagefind search indexing happens as part of the build.
